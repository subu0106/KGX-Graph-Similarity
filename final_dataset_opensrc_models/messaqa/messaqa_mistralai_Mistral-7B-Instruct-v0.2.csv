Your doctor will consider several factors before prescribing a specific corticosteroid, including your age, the severity and location of your disease, and potential side effects. It's important to follow instructions carefully to minimize risks and get the best results. Stronger corticosteroids can cause side effects such as thinning of the skin, changes in skin coloring, increased hair growth, and infections. Your doctor may prescribe a weaker corticosteroid for sensitive areas or for long-term use to minimize these risks.","[['Stronger corticosteroids', 'used for', 'treating severe form of psoriasis'], ['Stronger corticosteroids', 'used for', 'treating psoriasis with thicker skin'], [""Doctor's prescription"", 'considers', 'age, disease severity, and skin location'], [""Doctor's prescription"", 'considers', 'potential side effects'], ['Weaker corticosteroids', 'recommended for', 'sensitive areas'], [""Doctor's prescription"", 'recommends', 'lower-strength version for long-term use'], ['Mild to mid-strength corticosteroids', 'used for', 'children'], ['Stronger corticosteroids', 'used for', 'severe form of psoriasis'], ['Stronger corticosteroids', 'used for', 'spots with thicker skin'], [""Doctor's prescription"", 'depends on', 'strength of corticosteroid'], [""Doctor's prescription"", 'depends on', 'size of treated area'], [""Doctor's prescription"", 'depends on', 'duration of use']]","If you're trying to fight off the itchy patches that come with psoriasis, you're probably no stranger to creams, gels, and ointments.. There are lots out there, but one of the strongest weapons in your arsenal is something called a topical corticosteroid.. It can control the inflammation that makes your skin look puffy and red. "". Topical"" is just a fancy word for something you put on your skin.. You can't buy a corticosteroid like that without a prescription from your doctor.. The two of you will work together to find the strength and dose that works best for you.. Corticosteroids come in a wide variety of strengths.. They're ranked on a scale of 1 through 7.. If it's labeled ""1"" it means the drug is ""super potent"" or very strong.. When it has a ""7"" it's got a rating of ""least potent"" or very weak.. Your doctor will weigh several different things before he suggests a specific corticosteroid for you.. He'll consider your age, how severe your disease is, and the part of your body that's got an outbreak.. He'll also go over with you the potential side effects from the treatment.. Weaker corticosteroids are best if you need to use it on sensitive areas such as your face, groin, or breasts.. Your doctor may also prescribe a lower-strength version if you have to use it for a long time.. Mild to mid-strength ones can be used for children.. You may need a stronger one if you have a severe form of psoriasis.. It's also a good choice for spots with thicker skin, such as your palms or the soles of your feet.. Whether you get them depends a lot on the strength of the corticosteroid, how large an area you spread it on, and how long you use it.. To lower your risk, your doctor may look for the weakest one that can get the job done in the shortest time.. Some common side effects that could happen to you: Thinning of your skin Changes in skin coloring You bruise easily Stretch marks Skin gets reddish Broken blood vessels Increased hair growth in localized areas Infections You become sensitive to light Corticosteroids can be absorbed through your skin and sometimes cause health problems such as high blood pressure, high blood sugar, and a hormonal problem called Cushing's syndrome.. A few simple tips can help you get the best results -- and keep you safe, too: Follow instructions.. Don't wing it.. Your doctor will tell you how often to apply the medicine.. Don't overdo it.. When you put it on your skin, use a small amount and only on the area that needs treatment.. Skin only.. Never use a topical corticosteroid on your eyes unless your doctor tells you to.. It can cause glaucoma or cataracts.. Keep an eye on the calendar.. Use this treatment only for as long as your doctor says you should.. Don't stop suddenly.. If you do it can cause your psoriasis to flare up.. To keep that from happening, your doctor will slowly decrease the amount you use.","[['Stronger corticosteroids', 'can cause', 'side effects'], ['Side effects', 'include', 'skin thinning'], ['Side effects', 'include', 'changes in skin coloring'], ['Side effects', 'include', 'increased hair growth'], ['Side effects', 'include', 'infections'], [""Doctor's instructions"", 'important for', 'minimizing risks'], [""Doctor's instructions"", 'important for', 'getting best results'], ['Weaker corticosteroids', 'recommended for', 'sensitive areas'], [""Doctor's prescription"", 'considers', 'age'], [""Doctor's prescription"", 'considers', 'disease severity'], [""Doctor's prescription"", 'considers', 'body part with outbreak'], [""Doctor's prescription"", 'goes over', 'potential side effects'], ['Weaker corticosteroids', 'best for', 'long-term use on sensitive areas'], ['Mild to mid-strength corticosteroids', 'used for', 'children'], ['Stronger corticosteroids', 'used for', 'severe form of psoriasis'], ['Stronger corticosteroids', 'used for', 'spots with thicker skin'], ['Corticosteroids', 'absorbed through skin', 'can cause health problems'], ['Simple tips', 'help', 'get best results and keep safe'], ['Follow instructions', 'important for', 'safe use of corticosteroids'], ['Do not overdo application', 'important for', 'safe use of corticosteroids'], ['Do not use on eyes', 'important for', 'safe use of corticosteroids'], ['Use only for prescribed duration', 'important for', 'safe use of corticosteroids'], ['Do not stop suddenly', 'important for', 'avoiding psoriasis flare-up']]"
1,What do I need to know about the plague?,"The plague is a serious disease that can be fatal if not treated. It is caused by the bacteria Yersinia pestis. There are three types of plague: bubonic, pneumonic, and septicemic. Pneumonic plague is the most dangerous type and is the rarest. If you must be near someone who has pneumonic plague, wear a tight-fitting disposable surgical mask to protect yourself from breathing in the bacteria.","[['Yersinia pestis', 'causes', 'plague'], ['plague', 'has_type', 'bubonic'], ['plague', 'has_type', 'pneumonic'], ['plague', 'has_type', 'septicemic'], ['Yersinia pestis', 'transmitted_by', 'fleas'], ['plague', 'symptoms', 'fever'], ['plague', 'symptoms', 'chills'], ['plague', 'symptoms', 'headaches'], ['bubonic plague', 'symptoms', 'buboes'], ['septicemic plague', 'symptoms', 'bleeding_under_skin'], ['septicemic plague', 'symptoms', 'blackened_skin'], ['pneumonic plague', 'symptoms', 'cough'], ['pneumonic plague', 'symptoms', 'trouble_breathing'], ['pneumonic plague', 'symptoms', 'nausea'], ['pneumonic plague', 'symptoms', 'vomiting'], ['pneumonic plague', 'symptoms', 'shock']]","The plague, also known as the Black Death, is a bacterial disease caused by Yersinia pestis and transmitted by fleas. It can also be contracted directly from infected animals or people. The plague has three main types: bubonic, septicemic, and pneumonic. Bubonic plague is the most common and causes painful, swollen lymph nodes. Septicemic plague is more dangerous, affecting the blood and causing potential organ failure. Pneumonic plague is the rarest and deadliest, spreading through the air when someone coughs. While the chances of contracting the plague are low, it is more common in areas with known outbreaks, such as Africa, Asia, and South America, and among those who work with animals, hike, camp, or hunt. Symptoms include fever, chills, and headaches, along with swollen lymph nodes, bleeding under the skin","[['plague', 'also_known_as', 'Black_Death'], ['plague', 'transmitted_by', 'fleas'], ['plague', 'transmitted_by', 'animals'], ['plague', 'transmitted_by', 'people'], ['septicemic plague', 'more_dangerous_than', 'bubonic_plague'], ['plague', 'symptoms', 'fever'], ['plague', 'symptoms', 'chills'], ['plague', 'symptoms', 'headaches'], ['plague', 'symptoms', 'swollen_lymph_nodes'], ['plague', 'symptoms', 'bleeding_under_skin'], ['plague', 'symptoms', 'blackened_skin'], ['plague', 'symptoms', 'belly_pain'], ['plague', 'symptoms', 'diarrhea'], ['plague', 'symptoms', 'vomiting'], ['plague', 'symptoms', 'shock'], ['plague', 'risk_factors', 'areas_with_known_outbreaks'], ['plague', 'risk_factors', 'those_who_work_with_animals'], ['plague', 'risk_factors', 'hiking'], ['plague', 'risk_factors', 'camping'], ['plague', 'risk_factors', 'hunting'], ['plague', 'risk_factors', 'living_or_visiting_an_area_with_the_plague'], ['plague', 'treatment', 'ciprofloxacin'], ['plague', 'treatment', 'doxycycline'], ['plague', 'treatment', 'gentamicin'], ['plague', 'treatment', 'levofloxacin']]","You may think that the plague, once called the Black Death, must be extinct, disappearing with knights in armor and village blacksmiths.. But the disease that swept the world hundreds of years ago still lives.. And it's still dangerous.. But unlike our ancestors, we know what causes the plague.. And with quick treatment, it can be cured.. The plague is caused by bacteria called Yersinia pestis.. It's usually spread by fleas.. These bugs pick up the germs when they bite infected animals like rats, mice, or squirrels.. Then they pass it to the next animal or person they bite.. You can also catch the plague directly from infected animals or people.. Thanks to treatment and prevention, the plague is rare now.. Only a few thousand people around the world get it each year.. Most of the cases are in Africa (especially the Democratic Republic of Congo and Madagascar), India, and Peru.. The U. S. sees about seven cases a year, mostly in rural or remote areas in Southwestern states like Arizona, Colorado, New Mexico, and California.. After people catch the plague, the symptoms start 1-6 days later.. You feel very sick and weak and may have a fever, chills, and headaches.. Other symptoms depend on the three main kinds of plague: Bubonic plague.. This is the most common type.. It causes buboes, which are very swollen and painful lymph nodes under the arms, in the neck, or in the groin.. Without treatment, the bacteria can spread to other parts of the body.. Septicemic plague.. This type is more dangerous than bubonic plague.. It's when the bacteria have moved into the blood.. Signs include: Bleeding under the skin or from the mouth, nose, or bottom Blackened skin, especially on the nose, fingers, and toes Belly pain, diarrhea, vomiting, and shock Pneumonic plague.. This is when the bacteria are in the lungs.. It's the rarest form of the disease.. It's deadly without treatment.. It's also very contagious because the plague can spread through the air when a person coughs.. Symptoms include: Cough, sometimes with blood Trouble breathing Nausea and vomiting For most people, the chances of the plague are low.. But you're more likely to get if you visit or live in an area with the plague and you: Touch a living or dead animal that might have been infected, like a rat, mouse, squirrel, rabbit, or chipmunk Work with animals regularly Spend a lot of time outdoors working, hiking, camping, or hunting Spend time with someone who has the plague If you've been in an area with the plague and have symptoms, see a doctor right away.. Hours can make a difference.. Your doctor can run tests of blood, spit, or fluid from your lymph nodes to check for plague germs.. If you've been around someone who has the plague, your doctor may start treatment even if you don't have symptoms.. If you must be near the person, wear tight-fitting disposable surgical masks so you won't breathe in the plague bacteria.. If you have the plague, you'll be admitted to the hospital.. You'll get antibiotics like: Ciprofloxacin ( Cipro) Doxycycline ( Vibramycin) Gentamicin ( Garamycin) Levofloxacin ( Levaquin) Treatment works well.. With antibiotics, most people get better within a week or two.. But without treatment, most people with the plague die.. There's no vaccine for the plague in the U. S. So if you have a chance of contact with plague germs, take steps to protect yourself.. If you travel to Africa, Asia, or South America, check for traveler notices about plague outbreaks on the CDC website.. Avoid areas with the plague if you can, and stay away from sick or dead animals while you're there.. If you live in an area where there's been a case of the plague: Fill holes and gaps in your home to stop mice, rats, and squirrels from getting in.. Clean up your yard.. Get rid of piles of leaves, wood, and rocks where animals might make their homes.. Use bug repellent with DEET to prevent flea bites when you hike or camp.. Wear gloves if you have to touch wild animals, alive or dead.. Use flea control sprays or other treatments on your pets..

Symptoms can include cramping, breast tenderness, bloating, mood swings, acne, and sleep issues. The length and duration of a period can vary from woman to woman, with an average cycle lasting between 21 and 45 days. Additionally, hormonal factors and the use of contraceptives can impact the timing and heaviness of a woman's period.","[['Menstrual cycle', 'prepares_body_for', 'pregnancy'], ['Ovaries', 'release_egg', 'egg'], ['Hormones', 'rise_and_fall', 'menstrual_cycle'], ['Menstrual cycle', 'length', '21_days_to_45_days'], ['Menstrual cycle', 'symptoms', 'acne'], ['Menstrual cycle', 'symptoms', 'cramping'], ['Menstrual cycle', 'symptoms', 'hunger'], ['Menstrual cycle', 'symptoms', 'sleep_issues']]","var s_context; s_context= s_context || {}; s_context['wb.modimp'] = 'vidfloat'; if(webmd.useragent && webmd.useragent.ua.type === 'desktop'){ webmd.ads2.disable Initial Load(); webmd.ads2.disable Ads Init = true; $(function() { webmd.p.pim.increment(); $('.responsive-video-container').insert After('.module-social-share-container'); require(['video2/1/responsive-player/video-loader'], function(video Loader) { video Loader.init({ autoplay: webmd.useragent.ua.type === 'desktop' && !. !s_sensitive, chron ID: $('article embeded_module[type=video][align=top]:eq(0)').attr('chronic_id'), continuous Play: true, cp Options: { flyout: true }, display Ads: true, mode: 'in-article', sticky: true }) }); }); } else { $(function(){ $('.responsive-video-container').remove(); }); } Think about how old you were when you got your first period.. Now think about how old you may be when you enter menopause.. Your body and life will change a lot from one to the other, right?. So does your menstrual cycle.. When it comes to periods, ""normal"" covers a lot of ground.. Use the broad range of factors below as a guide.. And remember: The only true normal is what's normal for you.. Every month, your body prepares to get pregnant.. Your ovaries release an egg.. Hormones rise and fall.. This is your menstrual cycle.. It starts on the first day of your last period and ends on the first day of your next period.. Though the average cycle is 28 days long, anything between 21 and 45 days is considered normal.. That's a 24-day difference.. For the first year or two after menstruation begins, women tend to have longer cycles that don't start at the same time every month.. Older women often have shorter, more consistent cycles.. If you're on birth control pills or have an IUD, it can change the timing of your period.. Ask your doctor what's normal for your form of contraception.. How long your period lasts also varies.. The time from the first sign of blood to the last is usually in the 3 to 5 day range.. Anything from 2 days to a week-long period is normal.. If the egg your ovary releases every month isn't fertilized, the lining of your uterus sheds through your vagina.. This is your period.. The amount of blood that comes out of your body is called your menstrual flow.. Whether your flow is light, moderate, or heavy, it's all considered normal.. Some months your breasts may feel tender when you have your period.. Other months you may notice bloating around your abdomen or mood swings..

4,What is recovery like for an ankle sprain or fracture?,"An ankle sprain or fracture can be difficult to distinguish, but most sprains will heal on their own.

However, their healing processes differ significantly. For a sprain, most injuries will clear up on their own within days to several weeks, depending on the severity. Healing may involve anti-inflammatory medications and rehabilitation exercises, including range of motion, strengthening, and balance exercises. A fracture, on the other hand, requires medical intervention, including immobilization through crutches or a cast, alignment of the broken bones, and, in severe cases, surgery. Fracture recovery can take from 6 weeks to several months, with rehabilitation typically consisting of a basic home exercise program. It is essential to consult a doctor to determine the exact injury and receive appropriate treatment and advice.","[['Ankle injury', 'distinguishing feature', 'Ankle sprain or Ankle fracture'], ['Ankle injury', 'healing process', ""['rest', 'icing', 'compression', 'elevation']""], ['Ankle sprain', 'healing time', 'days to several weeks'], ['Ankle sprain', 'treatment', ""['anti-inflammatory medications', 'RICE method', 'physical therapy']""], ['Ankle fracture', 'healing time', '6 weeks to several months'], ['Ankle fracture', 'treatment', ""['medical intervention', 'immobilization', 'alignment of broken bones', 'surgery']""], ['Ankle fracture', 'complication', 'ligament damage']]","You've injured your ankle and can't put your weight on it.. It hurts and is tender to the touch, bruised, and swollen.. It could be a sprain, or it might be broken.. The symptoms of an ankle sprain are a lot like a fracture, but you'll need to know which injury you have so you can heal the right way.. This happens when you damage the ligaments in your ankle.. Ligaments are the tough, stretchy bands that hold your bones in place and help keep the joint stable.. They're meant to stretch and move, but only to a point.. A sprain means that a ligament is torn or stretched beyond its limits.. This happens when at least one of three bones in your ankle breaks.. If just one bone is broken, you may not realize how bad the injury is.. But if multiple bones break at once, you will lose stability in your ankle and may not be able to walk.. An ankle fracture can also lead to ligament damage.. To help figure out what the injury might be, ask yourself a few questions: Was there a noise when it happened?. A sprain may occur silently, or in severe cases there may be a popping sound.. With a fracture, you might hear a crack.. Is your ankle misshapen?. While swelling is a symptom of both injuries, if your ankle looks clearly âoff,â it's most likely because a bone is broken.. Does your ankle feel numb?. With a sprain, you feel pain.. But if you have numbness or tingling, your ankle is most likely broken.. Where is the pain?. If your ankle hurts or is tender to the touch directly over your ankle bone, you probably have a fracture.. If the pain is in the soft part of your ankle, it's more likely a sprain.. If you're still not sure, see your doctor.. He can examine your ankle and give you a number of tests to figure out which injury you have.. It's usually less involved when you are healing from a sprain.. Most sprains will clear up on their own.. You may take anti-inflammatory drugs such as ibuprofen ( Advil, Motrin) or naproxen ( Aleve).. And your doctor may advise you to try the â RICEâ method to ease your inflammation: Rest Ice Compression (with an elastic bandage) Elevation (ankle above the heart) You may need physical therapy for a moderate sprain.. You should start range of motion exercises once the pain and swelling subside.. Surgery is usually for severe cases when other treatments have failed.. If you think your ankle is broken, you should get medical treatment right away.. You need to have the ankle immobilized.. This could involve crutches or a cast.. Your doctor may try to align the broken bones to help you heal.. If the bones are unable to stay in place after your doctor has tried to stabilize the fracture, you might need surgery.. You can also apply ice, elevate your ankle, and take pain relievers.. Talk to your doctor.. These can be vastly different for the two injuries as well.. A sprain may clear up within days, with worse sprains needing several weeks to heal.. Fractures usually take much longer.. It could be 6 weeks to several months before you're back to your regular routine.. For most ankle fractures, you can do your rehab with a basic home exercise program of stretching, range of motion, strengthening, and balance exercises.","[['Ankle injury', 'symptoms', ""['pain', 'swelling', 'numbness', 'misshapen ankle']""], ['Ankle injury', 'diagnosis', ""doctor's examination and tests""], ['Ankle sprain', 'symptoms', 'pain and swelling in the soft part of the ankle'], ['Ankle sprain', 'healing process', 'mostly self-healing'], ['Ankle sprain', 'treatment', ""['anti-inflammatory drugs', 'RICE method', 'physical therapy']""], ['Ankle fracture', 'symptoms', 'pain and swelling directly over the ankle bone'], ['Ankle fracture', 'healing process', '6 weeks to several months'], ['Ankle fracture', 'treatment', ""['medical intervention', 'immobilization', 'alignment of broken bones', 'surgery']""]]"

It's important to note that depression doesn't have to be a normal part of aging, and proper treatment can significantly improve overall health and quality of life. Other risk factors for depression in older adults include having a chronic illness, being a woman, experiencing the death of a spouse, and dependence on in-home health care or hospital care.

In part, it's because it often shows up differently when you're older.. Even though it's common, it's not a normal part of aging.. You can control your symptoms with the right treatment, and live a healthier, fuller life.. Other things besides your age raise your chances of depression.. You're more likely to have it if you: Have had depression before Are a woman Have a chronic illness like diabetes Are disabled Don't sleep well Spend a lot of time alone Have other people in your family who've had depression Take certain medications Have a disease that affects your brain Abuse alcohol or drugs Are going through a stressful life event Dependence also raises your odds.. You're far more likely to be depressed if you need in-home health care or hospital care than if you live in the community.. It's common for depression to come with other health issues that often crop up after 65, like: Alzheimer's disease Parkinson's disease Heart disease Cancer Arthritis Sometimes it can be the medication for the above conditions that's to blame for depression symptoms.. Depression can often make these other health conditions worse, and vice versa.. Getting your depression under control often improves other medical issues and your overall health.. Depression often gets overlooked or misdiagnosed in seniors.. When you're older, you may not have the sad or empty feeling that's common with it.. Instead, you may: Feel tired Have trouble sleeping Be grumpy or irritable Feel confused Struggle to pay attention Not enjoy activities you used to Move more slowly Have a change in weight or appetite Feel hopeless, worthless, or guilty Endure aches and pains Have suicidal thoughts Sometimes, depression can hit after the death of a spouse.. It's normal to grieve, but one-third of widows and widowers have symptoms of it in the first month after their partner dies, and half of them still struggle with it a year later.. With the right plan, you can improve your quality of life.. The first step is to talk to your doctor.. You can see your general physician or a mental health specialist, like a psychiatrist or psychologist.. They'll examine you and take your medical history.. Different treatments work for different people.. Doctors usually recommend a medication, some sort of therapy, or both.. The type of medication your doctor prescribes will depend on many things, including your: Symptoms Health Other conditions you have and medications you're taking Meds you may get include: Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors ( SSRIs) like: Citalopram ( Celexa) Escitalopram ( Lexapro) Fluoxetine ( Prozac) Paroxetine ( Paxil) Sertraline ( Zoloft) Serotonin and norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors ( SNRIs) like: Desvenlafaxine ( Pristiq) Duloxetine ( Cymbalta) Venlafaxine ( Effexor) Atypical antidepressa nts, such as: Bupropion ( Wellbutrin) Trazodone ( Oleptro ER) Mirtazapine ( Remeron) Monamine oxidase inhibitors ( MAOIs), like: Isocarboxazid ( Marplan) Phenelzine ( Nardil) Selegiline ( Emsam, Zelapar, Eldepryl) Tranylcypromine ( Parnate) There's another class of antidepressants called tricyclic antidepressants, but they aren't used much in older adults because they have more side effects.. Talk to your doctor about them.. All antidepressants come with side effects, so your doctor will want to monitor how you're doing after you begin treatment.. He may need to tweak your dosage or change your medicine altogether.. Studies show that psychotherapy, or âtalk therapy,â works to treat mild to moderate depression in older adults just as well as medication.. Counseling with a trained professional can help you work through some of the things that trigger your depression.. It can also give you tools to deal with it.. Cognitive behavioral therapy ( CBT) is a special form of psychotherapy that trains you to turn negative thoughts into positive ones.. Problem-solving therapy also helps with older adults.. When medication and psychotherapy don't seem to make a difference in your symptoms, your doctor may recommend electroconvulsive therapy ( ECT).. It involves passing a brief small electrical current through electrodes placed on your scalp while you are under general anesthesia.. This causes a brief seizure..

6,What's the treatment for joints that bleed because of hemophilia?,"Treatment for joints that bleed because of hemophilia includes treating bleeding joints, monitoring physical activities, resting and icing the affected joint, and physical therapy.","[['Treatment for joints that bleed because of hemophilia', 'includes', 'treating bleeding joints'], ['Treatment for joints that bleed because of hemophilia', 'includes', 'monitoring physical activities'], ['Treatment for joints that bleed because of hemophilia', 'includes', 'resting and icing the affected joint'], ['Treatment for joints that bleed because of hemophilia', 'includes', 'physical therapy']]","Treatment for joint bleeding in hemophilia involves administering clotting factors to stop or prevent further bleeding. This can be done through intravenous infusions or weekly subcutaneous injections of medications like emicizumab-kxwh, Adynovate, or Idelvion, depending on the type and severity of hemophilia. Additionally, rest, icing, and physical therapy may help in managing pain, swelling, and regaining joint mobility and strength. Monitoring physical activities is also necessary to prevent injury and internal bleeding. However, complications from treatment include the risk of contracting blood-borne diseases and changes to the immune system that make the treatment less effective. Your doctor will advise on appropriate physical activities and monitor for any adverse reactions.","[['Treatment for joint bleeding in hemophilia', 'involves', 'administering clotting factors'], ['Administering clotting factors', 'can be done through', 'intravenous infusions'], ['Administering clotting factors', 'can be done through', 'weekly subcutaneous injections'], ['Administering clotting factors', 'depends on', 'type and severity of hemophilia'], ['Rest, icing, and physical therapy', 'help in managing', 'pain, swelling, and regaining joint mobility and strength'], ['Monitoring physical activities', 'is necessary to prevent', 'injury and internal bleeding']]","Normally, when bleeding begins, a complex series of chemical events produces a ""plug"" to stop the bleeding; this plug is called a fibrin clot.. The fibrin clot is the end-product of many different ""clotting factors"" reacting in the blood.. Hemophilia is an inherited condition in which one of these clotting factors (mainly factor VIII or IX) is absent from the blood, so that it does not clot normally.. If your health care provider suspects that you have hemophilia, you may be given blood tests to examine how well your blood creates this clot.. A lab mixes your blood with specific chemicals in a test tube, to produce a fibrin clot.. If such tests are abnormal, other blood tests are done to determine the amounts of factors VIII and IX in the blood.. These tests help doctors diagnose the type of hemophilia and its severity.. Treatments for hemophilia include: Receiving clotting factors replacement therapy Medication Treatment for joint bleeding and other problems associated with hemophilia The treatments you need will depend on the type of hemophilia and the severity of hemophilia.. For instance, if you have mild hemophilia, you may need treatment only when you've been injured or in preparation for surgery.. However, if you have severe hemophilia and bleed frequently, you may need regular treatment to help prevent bleeding and help protect your joints from deformity and disability.. Clotting Factors for Hemophilia People with hemophilia receive the appropriate clotting factor (factor VIII or factor IX).. Factor VIII replacement is used to treat hemophilia A and Factor IX is used in the treatment of hemophilia B.. The clotting factor is given intravenously (through a needle in your vein) to stop or prevent bleeding.. Factor preparations come from two sources: Donated blood plasma Synthetic ( DNA-derived) Newer types of these clotting factor products have been developed so they can last longer in the body.. This means that they do not have to be used as often.. Other medicines have also been developed to work with the clotting factors to stop bleeding.. Emicizumab-kxwh ( HEMLIBRA) is a medicine that can help prevent or reduce the frequency of bleeding episodes in adults and children with hemophilia A.. It works by bridging the gap in the clotting factors left by the missing factor VIII.. This medication is given as a weekly, under-the-skin (subcutaneous) injection.. A health care provider can give the injection, or you can learn to do it yourself.. Adynovate is used to replace clotting factor VIII to help prevent and control bleeding in adults and children with hemophilia A. Idelvion, Coagulation Factor IX ( Recombinant), albumin fusion protein is used to help control and prevent bleeding in children and adults with hemophilia B.. Delivered by IV, Idelvion can be effective for up to two weeks and is delivered either as needed to prevent bleeding episodes or to manage the frequency of bleeding episodes.. A form of clotting factor VIII derived from pigs called Obizur stops bleeding episodes in people with acquired hemophilia A.. This rare, dangerous form of the disease is not inherited.. Acquired hemophilia A can be related to pregnancy, cancer, or the use of certain medications.. However, no cause can be found in about half of the cases.. Other Medications for Hemophilia A If you have a mild form of hemophilia, a medication called desmopressin ( DDAVP) can temporarily increase the concentration of factor VIII in your blood.. DDAVP can be given intravenously, through an injection, or in the form of nasal spray.. Antifibrinolytic medicines such as tranexamic acid and aminocaproic acid are oral medicines that are sometimes used with replacement therapy in certain situations to help keep blood clots from breaking down.. Treatment for Joint Bleeding and Other Problems Other health issues associated with hemophilia may need to be addressed.. The most common include: Treating bleeding joints Monitoring physical activities For bleeding joints, you must get treatment with clotting factor to avoid joint damage.. Your doctor may also recommend resting and icing the affected joint to decrease pain and swelling.. As pain and swelling subsides, physical therapy may help you recover joint mobility and strength.. Monitoring physical activity may be necessary to prevent injury and internal bleeding.. Your doctor will discuss the types of physical activities that are appropriate and what kinds of activities may be too dangerous.. Your doctor's advice depends on the type and severity of hemophilia.. Possible Complications from Hemophilia Treatment Complications from treatment for hemophilia include: Acquiring a blood-borne disease Changes to the immune system that make the treatment less effective Acquiring a blood-borne disease: In the past, people receiving clotting factor from donated blood ran the risk of contracting a blood-borne disease.. In fact, in the late 1970s and 1980s, many people with hemophilia acquired viruses such as HIV (the virus that causes AIDS) and hepatitis.. Now, potential blood donors are carefully screened and all donated blood is tested for viruses.. Donated blood is also processed to inactivate any unrecognized viruses.. The chance of contracting any disease through treatment is now extremely low.. Still, if you have hemophilia it is important for you to receive immunizations for hepatitis A and B to help prevent becoming infected with these viruses.. Changes to the immune system: Your immune system may begin to recognize the administered clotting factor as foreign and then destroy it.. This makes your treatment ineffective.. Your doctor will want to monitor your (or your child's) blood for such a reaction.","[['Fibrin clot', 'is the end-product of', 'many different clotting factors reacting in the blood'], ['Hemophilia', 'is an inherited condition in which', 'one of these clotting factors is absent'], ['Blood tests', 'examine how well', 'blood creates a fibrin clot'], ['Abnormal blood tests', 'help doctors diagnose', 'type and severity of hemophilia'], ['Treatments for hemophilia', 'include', 'receiving clotting factors replacement therapy'], ['Treatments for hemophilia', 'include', 'medication treatment for joint bleeding and other problems'], ['Factor VIII replacement therapy', 'is used to treat', 'hemophilia A']]"

Both have apps and web sites to help you track your health.. Ditto isn't a glucose meter.. Instead, it's a small device that connects to your glucose meter.. It takes readings from your device -- it works with nine models -- and wirelessly sends them to an app on your phone, which uploads it to a web site.. Glooko is a cable that connects your phone to up to 21 different FDA-approved glucometers.. As soon as you connect the two, Glooko uploads the information to the cloud.. Store more readings.. If you're not getting a meter that syncs data, you might want one with a lot of memory to store readings.. Most meters save 100 to 450 readings, but some keep up to 3,000.. These devices can use all that data to show you charts and graphs of long-term trends right on the meter's display.. A few meters with big memories include the Contour USB, One Touch Ultra Smart, Up & Up Meter, and the Wave Sense Jazz.. Even if you don't want to spend the extra cash on a fancy syncing glucometer, you can get a lot of the same benefits with low-cost or free phone apps or web sites..

A lot of these apps and web sites have online communities that you can join.. Using them is a great way to get support and stay inspired.. Whether you're going for a high-tech glucometer or a more basic model, there are some key factors you need to consider.. The eyes have it.. Make sure your device has an easy-to-read display.. Some glucometers have a backlight so you can check readings in the dark, like the Contour Next Link, Easy Max Light, Freestyle Lite, One Touch Ping, and Wave Sense Presto.. Others have a bigger readout or a sharper contrast to make them easier to see.. Listen up.. If you have vision problems, check out a glucometer with voice readout -- it will speak your reading.. Some meters with voice readout include the Advocate Redi- Code, Easy Max Voice, Element Plus, Fora (many models), and Prodigy.. Give it a test run.. If you can, get your hands on a device before you buy it, so you'll know how it feels.. Make sure the buttons are well-placed and easy to press.. If you have trouble picking up small things or have dexterity issues with your hands, using larger strips may be more comfortable.. A glucometer with an attached strip drum or disk may be easier to handle, too.. You won't have to mess with those tiny, slippery test strips.. Watch for hidden costs.. Don't forget to price the strips --a cheap or even a free glucometer can be costlier in the long run because the strips are so expensive.. Make sure your insurance company will cover the strips for any device you choose.. Pass the test.. Find out if the monitor tests itself to make sure it's accurate.. If it doesn't self-test, you may occasionally use a control solution -- a testing liquid with a specific glucose level -- on a strip to make sure it's working correctly.. Also, find out if the meter needs to be cleaned, and how.. Time's a wastin'.. Make sure you don't have to enter a code or special key when changing test strips.. That's a hassle you don't need.. To get a sense what glucose meter will suit you best -- and what data or design will help most -- ask your doctor or diabetes educator for advice.","[['Glucose monitoring', 'can_be_done_using', 'devices_that_transmit_data'], ['devices_that_transmit_data', 'include', 'i_Health_Wireless_Smart_Gluco-Monitoring_System'], ['i_Health_Wireless_Smart_Gluco-Monitoring_System', 'syncs_with', 'phone'], ['phone', 'has', 'apps_and_websites'], ['apps_and_websites', 'provide', 'features_for_glucose_monitoring'], ['features_for_glucose_monitoring', 'includes', 'sharing_data_with_others'], ['sharing_data_with_others', 'can_be_done_with', 'doctor_or_loved_ones'], ['Glucose monitoring', 'can_be_done_using', 'devices_that_store_readings'], ['devices_that_store_readings', 'include', 'Contour_USB'], ['Contour_USB', 'stores', 'up_to_3_000_readings']]"
8,What do you need to know about moderate aortic stenosis?,"Moderate aortic stenosis is a condition in which the aortic valve narrows, reducing blood flow to the heart and rest of the body.

Symptoms can include chest pain, tightness, shortness of breath during physical activity, heart palpitations, and a heart murmur during examination. Treatment depends on the severity of symptoms and test results, with severe cases typically requiring surgery to repair or replace the valve. However, individuals without symptoms may be monitored closely, as this stage can progress to severe aortic stenosis if left untreated.","[['Moderate aortic stenosis', 'causes_symptoms', ""['Chest pain', 'Tightness', 'Shortness of breath during physical activity', 'Heart palpitations', 'Heart murmur']""], ['Moderate aortic stenosis', 'requires_treatment', ""['Surgery', 'Monitoring']""], ['Moderate aortic stenosis', 'affects_stage', ""['Severe_aortic_stenosis']""], ['Severe aortic stenosis', 'has_symptoms', ""['Chest pain', 'Tightness', 'Shortness of breath when active', 'Fainting', 'Heart failure', 'Intense fatigue', 'Swelling of ankles and feet', 'Arrhythmias', 'Sudden cardiac death']""], ['Heart failure', 'is_a', 'Condition'], ['Arrhythmias', 'is_a', 'Heart_condition'], ['Sudden cardiac death', 'is_a', 'Heart_condition'], ['Condition', 'has_organ', 'Heart'], ['Heart', 'has_function', 'Circulates_blood'], ['Heart', 'has_function', 'Contracts'], ['Heart_condition', 'affects_organ', 'Heart'], ['Heart_condition', 'affects_organ', 'Body'], ['Surgery', 'is_a', 'Medical_procedure'], ['Monitoring', 'is_a', 'Medical_procedure'], ['Medical_procedure', 'has_purpose', 'Treatment']]","Aortic stenosis is a type of heart valve disease.. Your doctor may classify it as mild, moderate, or severe.. Which stage you have depends on how damaged your aortic valve is and the amount of blood that's still able to pass through it.. Even so, not everyone will have the same symptoms or need the same treatments.. Your aortic valve transfers blood from the left ventricle of your heart to your aorta, the largest artery you have.. If something causes this valve to narrow, you can't get as much blood flow to your heart and the rest of your body.. While aortic stenosis is most common in older people, some children are born with it.. Aortic stenosis might not affect your health right away.. In fact, many people who have a mild case may not notice any symptoms.. As your aortic valve's opening slowly starts to shrink with this condition, your heart muscle picks up the slack.. It can take many years for this extra work to cause severe damage to your heart muscle.. The most common early warning signs are: Needing to make more effort than usual during a physical activity Feeling tired all the time A child or infant with the condition could also have chest pain after a lot of activity.. Because these symptoms are so subtle, most people find out about mild cases during a checkup.. When your doctor listens to your heart, she may hear an abnormal whooshing sound between heartbeats.. Called a heart murmur, this distinct sound can show up long before other aortic stenosis symptoms.. You can have a slightly more advanced case of aortic stenosis but still not show any symptoms.. Or, you may start to feel the effects of a smaller aortic valve opening and the strain that's putting on your heart.. If your condition is moderate, you may notice: Feeling out of breath, especially when you're active Chest pain Tightness or pressure in your chest Heart palpitations (rapid heartbeats) Feeling that your normal exercise has become harder Your doctor may also hear a heart murmur during an exam.. Over time, your aortic valve opening may end up going from the size of a nickel to about the size of the head of a golf tee.. This continues to cause more wear and tear on your heart.. If your aortic stenosis is severe, you may have the same symptoms as some people with moderate cases -- such as chest pain, tightness, shortness of breath when you're active, and fainting.. These signs can also mean that the disease is starting to worsen more quickly.. If left untreated, severe aortic stenosis can lead to heart failure.. Intense fatigue, shortness of breath, and swelling of your ankles and feet are all signs of this.. It can also lead to heart rhythm problems (arrhythmias) and even sudden cardiac death.. Still, some people -- especially older adults -- can have a severe case without any symptoms.. The only warning you may have is a lower amount of energy when you do physical activity.. If so, it might be what doctors call asymptomatic aortic stenosis.. Because signs of this condition vary so widely, your doctor will want to do tests to see how well your heart is working.. Your treatment will be based on your symptoms as well as what these tests show.. In severe cases, surgery is likely needed to repair or replace your aortic valve.. But if you're not having any symptoms, your doctor may want to off on medical treatments.. Instead, he may suggest âwatchful waiting,â which means simply keeping a close eye on your heart health for now and treating any other cardiac conditions you may have.","[['Aortic stenosis', 'is_a', 'Heart_valve_disease'], ['Heart_valve_disease', 'has_disease', 'Aortic_stenosis'], ['Aortic stenosis', 'affects_age_group', 'Older_people'], ['Aortic stenosis', 'affects_age_group', 'Children'], ['Children', 'has_age', '<1'], ['Older_people', 'has_age_range', '>65'], ['Aortic stenosis', 'has_stage', ""['Mild', 'Moderate', 'Severe']""], ['Mild aortic stenosis', 'has_symptoms', ""['None']""], ['Moderate aortic stenosis', 'has_symptoms', ""['Shortness of breath', 'Chest pain', 'Heart palpitations', 'Difficulty exercising', 'Tightness or pressure in the chest']""], ['Severe aortic stenosis', 'has_symptoms', ""['Chest pain', 'Tightness', 'Shortness of breath when active', 'Fainting', 'Heart failure', 'Intense fatigue', 'Swelling of ankles and feet', 'Arrhythmias', 'Sudden cardiac death']""], ['Aortic stenosis', 'affects_organ', 'Heart'], ['Aortic stenosis', 'affects_organ', 'Body'], ['Heart', 'has_function', 'Circulates_blood'], ['Body', 'has_function', 'Receives_blood'], ['Aortic valve', 'has_function', 'Transfers_blood'], ['Aortic valve', 'is_a', 'Heart_valve'], ['Heart_valve', 'has_disease', 'Aortic_stenosis'], ['Aortic_stenosis', 'has_stage', 'Moderate']]"

Do you notice them after a particular activity or first thing in the morning?. Note when your joint stiffness first began, and also ask yourself: Did it start suddenly?. Does it come and go?. Is it painful?. Has it changed in intensity over time or moved to new joints?. See a doctor if your joint stiffness, pain, or swelling lasts more than 2 weeks.. She may refer you to a rheumatologist, a doctor who specializes in arthritis and other diseases of joints, muscles, and bones.. At your appointment, share your list of symptoms and also mention anything that's not related to your joints, such as fatigue or weight loss.. Your doctor may ask you to move the joint so he can see its range of motion.. He will also check your joint for swelling, enlargement, and tenderness.. You might also take some blood tests to help find out what the problem is.. If you have RA, early treatment can greatly limit joint damage.. Your treatment plan will likely include these key parts: Medications.. There are different kinds of drugs that treat rheumatoid arthritis.. You may need to take more than one.. Some stop the disease from getting worse.. Others ease symptoms of joint stiffness and pain.. Physical therapy and exercise.. These will help you move better and with less pain.. You can also use moist heat (like a warm shower) to loosen up stiff joints, and ice packs (or even a bag of frozen peas) to curb inflamed joints.. Relaxation techniques also ease muscle tension.. An occupational therapist can show you how to do everyday activities.. It's also important to get to, and stay at, a healthy weight, so you don't stress your joints.. If you're not sure what your weight goal should be, ask your doctor.. Pace yourself.. Switch between periods of rest and activity.. At least once a day, gently move your joints through their range of motion.. If needed, use assistive devices to make your daily tasks easier.","[['Joint stiffness', 'is a symptom of', 'rheumatoid arthritis'], ['Joint stiffness', 'can affect various areas including', 'Fingers and hands'], ['Joint stiffness', 'can affect various areas including', 'Wrists'], ['Joint stiffness', 'can affect various areas including', 'Elbows'], ['Joint stiffness', 'can affect various areas including', 'Knees'], ['Joint stiffness', 'can affect various areas including', 'Ankles'], ['Joint stiffness', 'can affect various areas including', 'Feet'], ['Joint stiffness', 'can affect various areas including', 'Shoulders'], ['Joint stiffness', 'can affect various areas including', 'Hips'], ['Joint stiffness', 'can affect various areas including', 'Jaw'], ['Symptoms of rheumatoid arthritis', 'include', 'joint stiffness'], ['Symptoms of rheumatoid arthritis', 'include', 'pain'], ['Symptoms of rheumatoid arthritis', 'include', 'fatigue'], ['Symptoms of rheumatoid arthritis', 'include', 'weight loss'], ['Doctor', 'may refer to', 'rheumatologist'], ['Rheumatologist', 'specializes in', 'arthritis and other diseases of joints, muscles, and bones'], ['Doctor', 'may ask', 'patient to move joint'], ['Doctor', 'may check', 'joint for swelling, enlargement, and tenderness'], ['Doctor', 'may conduct', 'blood tests'], ['Treatment plan for rheumatoid arthritis', 'includes', 'medications'], ['Treatment plan for rheumatoid arthritis', 'includes', 'Physical therapy and exercise'], ['Treatment plan for rheumatoid arthritis', 'includes', 'moist heat'], ['Treatment plan for rheumatoid arthritis', 'includes', 'ice packs'], ['Treatment plan for rheumatoid arthritis', 'includes', 'relaxation techniques'], ['Treatment plan for rheumatoid arthritis', 'includes', 'occupational therapy'], ['Treatment plan for rheumatoid arthritis', 'includes', 'weight management'], ['Treatment plan for rheumatoid arthritis', 'includes', 'pacing'], ['Treatment plan for rheumatoid arthritis', 'includes', 'assistive devices']]"
11,I feel bad about not sticking to healthy habits. What can I do about it?,"If you find yourself not sticking to your healthy habits, you can try using anchors to help you remember them and get in the right mindset to do them.

Triggers can be a note, a text message, or an alarm that cues you to do the desired habit, while anchors can be personal items or sensory experiences that bring back positive emotions and feelings associated with your goals.

Or skip the gym after you vow to increase activity?. Don't beat yourself up for a lack willpower or resolve.. You may just need reminders to do your habits -- and how much you want the changes they'll bring.. The word ""trigger"" often describes something that starts as an unhealthy behavior.. Your workout buddy changing your gym time triggers you to skip it.. Worrying about a sick parent leads you to overeat.. But a trigger can also be a prompt to do something you want to do.. You can set up any kind of trigger: an alarm, a note, a text message.. A good trigger is one you'll both notice and link to what you want to do.. You also want to time it to coincide with the action you want to take.. Here are some examples to get you thinking.. Feel free to try these, but you'll have the most success if you pick something personal to you.. Habit: Take a walk each morning.. Trigger: Set your sneakers beside your bed the night before.. Spotting the shoes first thing will cue you to lace up and get moving.. Habit: Drink more water.. Trigger: Set an alarm to ring every 2 hours to help you remember to empty and refill your glass.. Habit: Use your home gym or treadmill.. Trigger: Put a timer on a light near your treadmill to come on when it's time to use it.. Habit: Get more exercise with your dog.. Trigger: Link it with something else you already do.. For instance, when you open your front door at home, let it be your reminder to play fetch with the dog.. Habit: Do stretches before bed.. Trigger: Let the first touch of your toothbrush to your teeth remind you to do your habit.. Habit: Make healthy food choices.. Trigger: Tie a colorful, eye-catching bow on your fridge to jolt you not to make an unhealthy food choice.. ( Put one on your TV remote, if you're trying to limit screen time.). Another way to cue yourself is to use an anchor.. Triggers remind you of the healthy habits you want to take to reach your goal.. Anchors help psych you up to do them.. When you come in contact with an anchor, you relive the feelings and thoughts you have linked with it.. For instance, the sound of a rocking chair always makes you sleepy because it's anchored to your parents rocking you to sleep.. All anchors don't have to be unconscious, though.. You can also create an anchor intentionally to relive a particular feeling or motivation on demand.. In that way, anchors help you remember your healthy habits and give you the mind-set you need to do them.. Let's say you're listening to music while you're on the treadmill, and you feel supercharged during a particular song.. That song can become your anchor for those feelings.. When you replay it, you'll feel the same energy boost you got during that workout.. Another example of an anchor you hear is a sound like ""shhh."". You can use that sound to relax yourself.. Or you can use a mantra, like "" I am calm."". You can also trigger your habit with sight or touch.. Think about a personal item that reminds you of a time you felt especially strong.. When you need those feelings back, look at the item or touch it.. Some people use a ring or wristband.. Others consider their fitness device the anchor that gives them a power boost.","[['Person(Emily Carter)', 'has_collaborated_with', 'Organization(GenHealth_Labs)'], ['Person(Emily Carter)', 'has_function', 'Function(conducting_clinical_trials)'], ['Organization(GenHealth_Labs)', 'has_function', 'Function(conducting_clinical_trials)'], ['Thing(triggers_or_anchors)', 'is_used_for', 'Goal(adopting_healthy_habits)'], ['Thing(triggers_or_anchors)', 'is_a_type_of', 'Object(personal_item_or_sensory_experience)'], ['Thing(triggers_or_anchors)', 'is_linked_to', 'Goal(maintaining_healthy_habits)'], ['Thing(FDA_approval)', 'is_a_type_of', 'Event(approval)'], ['Event(approval)', 'occurred_at', 'Time(2023)'], ['Person(Emily Carter)', 'has_experience', 'Experience(collaborating_with_GenHealth_Labs)'], ['Person(Emily Carter)', 'has_experience', 'Experience(conducting_clinical_trials)']]"

Long-term consequences of persistently high blood sugar levels include an increased risk for heart disease, stroke, and kidney disease. It is crucial to regularly monitor and manage blood sugar levels to avoid both short-term and long-term health issues. The American Diabetes Association recommends checking blood sugar levels before meals and 1-2 hours after eating, noting any potential influences on blood sugar levels and documenting exact food intake. Maintaining consistent and healthy eating habits, such as eating a protein-rich breakfast, limiting sweets and processed foods, and incorporating healthy fats, can also help manage blood sugar levels.

But how do you handle a spike that comes after you eat?. It's called ""postprandial"" blood glucose, and if you take some simple steps, you can get it under control and help avoid health problems.. When your blood sugar is high, you can get symptoms like a foggy-headed feeling that makes it hard to focus or think clearly.. Your energy may also take a dive, and you may feel nervous or moody.. If your levels go too low, you could even pass out.. In the long run, if your blood sugar stays up, you could be at risk for heart disease, stroke, kidney disease, or other problems.. The American Diabetes Association ( ADA) recommends you check your blood sugar levels right before mealtime with a blood sample from a finger stick.. Then do it again 1 to 2 hours after that first bite of food.. Keep this up for a week or so.. Write down the time and the blood sugar number.. Make a note about anything you think might affect your levels, like medicine or exercise.. And don't forget to log exactly what you ate, along with portion sizes and the amount of carbs.. What levels are too high after a meal?. Experts vary on what the number should be, but the ADA says a general goal is a blood sugar level under 180 mg/d L, 1 to 2 hours after a meal.. Talk to your doctor about what you should aim for, and don't adjust your medicine without speaking to him first.. Get medicine that works for you.. The right insulin or medication program can make a big difference.. In general, to cover after-meal spikes, those that kick in quickly and for a short time are a better choice than ones that work slowly over a long period.. Your doctor can explain your options.. Keep blood sugar in check before meals.. That way, even if it goes up after you eat, it won't be so dramatic.. Watch what you eat.. Limit sweets, white bread, rice, pasta, and potatoes.. They tend to trigger post-meal spikes.. The type of fat you eat may play a role, as well.. One study shows you may be able to curb blood sugar spikes after you eat if you skip foods with lots of butter and choose a meal made with a little olive oil instead.. Eat breakfast every morning.. Even when you're in a hurry to get out the door, don't be tempted to skip it.. A study shows that folks with diabetes who don't eat breakfast get higher blood sugar spikes after lunch and dinner.. The ideal morning meal?. It might just be one that's packed with protein.. A small study shows that when people ate a 500-calorie breakfast that was 35% protein, their post-meal blood sugar levels were lower than those who started their day with high-carb food.. But check with your doctor to see what's right for you.. Go for an after-dinner walk..

If you have Ps A and you're overweight, you're more likely to have pain, tender and swollen joints, and other symptoms than people who aren't carrying extra pounds, a recent study showed..

And, it could make it hard for your doctor to figure out the right dose of medication to prescribe for your condition.. Drop the weight, and you'll ease the symptoms that come with this painful condition, the National Psoriasis Foundation says.. These tips will help you stick with a healthy diet: Load your plate with fruit, vegetables, and whole grains.. Avoid potatoes, tomatoes, and peppers, as they can increase swelling..

Two good choices are riding an exercise bike or walking.. Use shoe inserts to avoid too much pressure on your feet, ankles, or knees.. You might also try water exercises, like swimming or walking laps in the pool.. You'll get a good workout but won't stress your joints..

If you want to put the sparkle back in your love life, learn why sexual performance anxiety might be happening to you and get some tips to put yourself at ease.. Sex is more than just a physical response.. Your emotions have something to do with it, too.. When your mind is too stressed out to focus on sex, your body can't get excited either.. Lots of different worries can lead to the problem: Fear that you won't perform well in bed and satisfy your partner sexually Poor body image, including concern over your weight Problems in your relationship Worry that your penis won't ""measure up"" Concern about ejaculating too early or taking too long to reach orgasm Anxiety about not being able to have an orgasm or enjoy the sexual experience These things may lead your body to release stress hormones like epinephrine and norepinephrine.. Your state of mind can have a big impact on your ability to get aroused.. Even if you're with someone who you find sexually appealing, worrying about whether you'll be able to please your partner can make it impossible for you to do just that.. One of the effects of the stress hormones is to narrow blood vessels.. When less blood flows into your penis, it's more difficult to have an erection.. Even guys who normally don't have any trouble getting excited might not be able to get an erection when they're overcome by sexual performance anxiety.. Sexual performance anxiety isn't diagnosed as often in women as it is in men, but it can affect arousal in women, too.. Anxiety can prevent women from getting lubricated enough to have sex, and it can take away the physical desire to make love.. Anxiety can take you out of the right mind-set for sex.. When you're focused on whether you'll perform well, you can't concentrate on what you're doing in bed.. Even if you are able to get aroused, you may be too distracted to reach orgasm.. Sexual performance anxiety leads to a cycle of troubles.. You might become so anxious about sex that you can't perform, which leads to even more sexual performance anxiety.. If you've got sexual performance anxiety, see a doctor -- someone you're comfortable enough with to discuss your sex life.. The doctor will examine you and do some tests to make sure a health condition or medication isn't the cause of your problems.. During the exam your doctor will ask about your sexual history to find out how long you've had sexual performance anxiety and what kinds of thoughts are interfering with your sex life.. Medications and other therapies can help treat erectile dysfunction and other sexual problems that have physical causes.. If a medical issue isn't to blame, your doctor might suggest you try one of these approaches: Talk to a therapist.. Make an appointment with a counselor or therapist who has experience in treating sexual problems.. Therapy can help you understand and then reduce or get rid of the issues that are causing your sexual performance anxiety.. If you worry about premature ejaculation, for example, you can try some techniques that help you gain more control.. Be open with your partner.. Talking with your partner about your anxiety can help ease some of your worries.. When you try to reach a solution together, you may draw closer as a couple and improve your sexual relationship.. Get intimate in other ways.. Learn how to be intimate without sexual intercourse.. Give your partner a sensual massage or take a warm bath together.. Take turns pleasing each other with masturbation so you don't always have to feel pressured to perform sexually.. Exercise .. Not only does working out make you feel better about your body, it also improves your stamina in bed.. Distract yourself.. Put on some romantic music or a sexy movie while you make love.. Think about something that turns you on.. Taking your mind off your sexual performance can remove the worries that stop you from getting excited.. Finally, take it easy on yourself..

Symptoms may go away when riding in a car or train, but they return when the person stops moving.","[['Mal de debarquement syndrome', 'is characterized by', 'feelings of rocking, swaying, or bobbing'], ['symptoms of Mal de debarquement syndrome', 'include', 'anxiety, confusion, depression, fatigue, difficulty concentrating'], ['Mal de debarquement syndrome', 'may be triggered by', 'being in a closed-in space, fast movement, flickering lights, stress, tiredness, and intense visual activity']]","Mal de debarquement syndrome, also known as'sickness of disembarkment,' is a rare condition characterized by persistent feelings of rocking, swaying, or bobbing even when you're not in motion. Symptoms may include anxiety, confusion, depression, fatigue, difficulty focusing, and unsteadiness. These feelings may go away when you're in a moving vehicle but return when you're still. Other triggers include being in a closed-in space, fast movement, flickering lights, stress, tiredness, and intense visual activity. Mal de debarquement syndrome can occur after a trip on a cruise ship or after riding in a car, train, or plane, and it may take a few visits to doctors to diagnose. Treatment options include brain stimulation therapy, medication, and vestibular rehabilitation, along with self-care such as exercise, stress management, and rest.","[['Mal de debarquement syndrome', 'also known as', ""'sickness of disembarkment'""], ['symptoms of Mal de debarquement syndrome', 'may include', 'unsteadiness, staggering'], ['treatment options for Mal de debarquement syndrome', 'include', 'brain stimulation therapy, medication, and vestibular rehabilitation'], ['self-care for Mal de debarquement syndrome', 'includes', 'exercise, stress management, and rest']]","When you head out to sea on a cruise ship, your brain and body have to get used to the constant motion.. It's called âgetting your sea legs,â and it keeps you from crashing into a wall every time the ship bobs up or down.. When you get back on shore, you need time to get your land legs back.. That usually happens within a few minutes or hours, but it can take up to 2 days.. With mal de debarquement syndrome, though, you can't shake the feeling that you're still on the boat.. That's French for âsickness of disembarkment.â You feel like you're rocking or swaying even though you're not.. It can happen to anyone, but it's much more common in women ages 30 to 60.. It's not clear if hormones play a role.. People who get migraines may be more likely to get it, too, but doctors aren't sure how the two conditions are linked.. Mainly, you feel like you're rocking, swaying, or bobbing when there's no reason for it.. You might feel unsteady and even stagger a bit.. Other symptoms include: Anxiety Confusion Depression Feeling very tired Having a hard time focusing Your symptoms may go away when you ride in a car or train, but they'll come back when you stop moving.. And they can get worse with: Being in a closed-in space Fast movement Flickering lights Stress Tiredness Trying to be still, like when you're going to sleep Intense visual activity, like playing video games It happens most often after you've been out on the ocean, but riding in planes, trains, and cars can lead to it, too.. It's even been caused by water beds, elevators, walking on docks, and using virtual reality.. While almost any kind of motion can cause it, doctors don't know what's really behind it.. In most cases, you get it after a longer trip.. But there's no tie between the length of your trip and how bad the symptoms are or how long they last.. It's a rare condition, so it may take a few visits to figure it out.. Your doctor probably will want to rule out other causes for your symptoms with things like: Blood tests A hearing exam Imaging scans of your brain An exam that makes sure your nervous system is working the way it should An exam to test your vestibular system, which keeps you balanced and steady If you've had the symptoms for more than a month and the tests don't turn up any reason for them, your doctor may tell you that you have mal de debarquement syndrome.. It's a hard condition to treat -- no one thing works every time.. It often goes away on its own within a year.. That's more common the younger you are.. A few things your doctor might recommend include: Brain stimulation therapy.. This uses electrical signals to change how your brain works.. It's a newer therapy but has shown promise in recent studies.. Medicine.. There's no drug made just for mal de debarquement syndrome, but certain medications used to treat things like depression, anxiety, or insomnia may help some people.. Drugs used for motion sickness won't help.. Vestibular rehabilitation.. Your doctor can show you special exercises to help you with steadiness and balance.. Taking care of yourself.. Exercise, managing stress, and getting rest may give you some relief.. There's no sure way.. If you've had mal de debarquement syndrome before, it's probably best to stay away from the type of motion that brought it on..

It's estimated that 95% of adults in the United States have been infected with EBV by age 40. Even though most people don't get sick from the virus, it can cause mononucleosis, also known as the ""kissing disease,"" which can have mild to severe symptoms. Once you're infected with EBV, the virus stays in your body and can become active again months or years later, making you contagious once more. It's best to avoid close contact with anyone who has mono to prevent infection. No vaccine is available to protect against EBV, but practicing good hygiene, such as not sharing personal items or kissing someone who's infected, can help reduce the risk.","[['Epstein-Barr virus', 'can_cause_symptoms', ""['fatigue', 'fever', 'lack_of_appetite', 'rash', 'sore_throat', 'swollen_glands', 'weakness', 'sore_muscles']""], ['symptoms_of_mono', 'can_take_time_to_appear', '4_to_6_weeks'], ['symptoms_of_mono', 'can_last_longer_than_2_to_4_weeks', 'true'], ['symptoms_of_mono', 'can_be_mild_to_severe', 'true'], ['symptoms_of_mono', 'can_affect_children_and_adults', 'true'], ['symptoms_of_mono', 'can_be_mistaken_for_other_illnesses', 'true'], ['symptoms_of_mono', 'can_require_doctor_exam', 'true'], ['symptoms_of_mono', 'can_be_diagnosed_through_tests', 'true'], ['symptoms_of_mono', 'can_require_rest', 'true'], ['symptoms_of_mono', 'can_require_hydration', 'true'], ['symptoms_of_mono', 'can_require_painkillers', 'true'], ['symptoms_of_mono', 'can_require_easing_back_into_work_or_school', 'true'], ['symptoms_of_mono', 'can_require_avoiding_vigorous_activities', 'true']]","Epstein- Barr is the virus that causes mononucleosis.. You might know this disease better by its nickname, ""mono."". It's also called the ""kissing disease"" because of one way you can spread it to someone else.. Even though Epstein- Barr virus ( EBV) isn't a household name, you've probably been infected without knowing it.. Lots of people carry the virus but don't get sick.. Once you're infected with EBV, symptoms can take 4 to 6 weeks to show up.. When they do, they're often mild, especially in young children.. Kids' symptoms may be more like those of a cold or flu.. Teens often have more obvious symptoms of mono.. If you do get symptoms, most likely you'll have: Fatigue Fever Lack of appetite Rash Sore throat Swollen glands in the neck Weakness and sore muscles Although you should start feeling better in 2 to 4 weeks, the fatigue can stick around much longer.. You may still feel tired a couple of months later.. The virus is found in saliva, so you can catch mono from kissing someone who's infected.. You can also get it from drinking from the same glass or using an infected person's toothbrush.. It's also found in blood and semen, so it's possible to get mono from sex, a blood transfusion, or an organ transplant.. You don't have to be sick to pass the virus to someone else.. EBV stays in your body long after you get over mono.. The virus can become active again months or years later, making you contagious once more.. It's hard to tell whether you have mononucleosis just by your symptoms.. Fever, fatigue, and sore throat could also be signs of other illnesses, like the flu or a cold.. See your doctor for an exam to learn for sure what's making you sick.. He might find signs that you have mono, such as an enlarged spleen, an organ in your belly that filters blood.. Your doctor will also check to see if you have a swollen liver and white patches on your tonsils.. You may also need to get some blood tests.. One test looks for antibodies, substances your immune system makes in response to the EBV virus.. Another test looks for a type of white blood cell your body uses to fight off the EBV infection.. Like other viruses, Epstein- Barr can't be treated with antibiotics.. Mono should clear up on its own without treatment in a few weeks.. Although no medicine can cure an EBV infection, you can take these steps at home to ease your symptoms: Get plenty of rest.. Drink a lot of water and other liquids to stay hydrated.. Suck on lozenges or ice pops, or gargle with warm salt water, to make your sore throat feel better.. Take painkillers like acetaminophen or ibuprofen to bring down fever and relieve body aches.. ( Don't give aspirin to children under 19 years of age because of the risk of a rare but serious condition called Reye's syndrome.). Ease back into work or school, taking things slowly until you feel better.. For a month or so, avoid sports, heavy lifting, or other vigorous activities in which you could injure your spleen.. No vaccine can protect you against the EBV virus.. The best way to avoid catching it is to stay away from anyone who has mono.. Don't share any items, including glasses, silverware, and toothbrushes, with someone who is infected.. Also avoid kissing or having sex with an infected person.. There are some rare complications of mono, so see your doctor if you or your child has any of these symptoms: Sudden, sharp pain on the left side of the belly, which could mean a problem with your spleen Very little urine, a sign of dehydration Trouble breathing or swallowing -- call 911 immediately Also call if your symptoms don't go away after 4 to 6 weeks.. You could have another type of infection besides mononucleosis.. EBV is best known for causing mononucleosis, but less often it can lead to other diseases, including: Ear infections and diarrhea in children Guillain- Barre syndrome Certain cancers, including Burkitt's lymphoma and cancers of the nose and throat Studies also show a link between EBV and multiple sclerosis ( MS), but more research is needed to determine if the virus can lead to MS.","[['Epstein-Barr virus', 'can_cause_complications', ""['ear_infections', 'diarrhea', 'guillain_barre_syndrome', 'cancers', 'burkitt_lymphoma', 'nose_and_throat_cancers']""], ['complications_of_mono', 'can_require_doctor_attention', 'true'], ['complications_of_mono', 'can_be_rare', 'true'], ['complications_of_mono', 'can_be_serious', 'true']]"

Bilirubin is a pigment that occurs naturally when red blood cells break down, and its levels are usually maintained by the liver, which converts it into a form that can be excreted through bile. However, if the liver isn't functioning properly, the bilirubin levels can build up in the blood, leading to jaundice and other symptoms. Certain medications and conditions, such as heavy drinking, can also affect the liver's ability to process bilirubin, leading to high levels in the blood. In newborns, high bilirubin levels that don't level out in a few days to 2 weeks may be a sign of various underlying conditions","[['High total bilirubin', 'can lead to', 'jaundice'], ['jaundice', 'is a condition characterized by', 'yellowing of skin and eyes'], ['Bilirubin', 'is a component of', 'bile'], ['Bilirubin', 'is produced from', 'red blood cells'], ['Liver', 'is responsible for', 'processing bilirubin'], ['Liver', 'can be affected by', 'conditions such as cirrhosis, hepatitis, and gallstones'], ['Liver', 'can be affected by', 'heavy drinking'], ['Liver', 'can be affected by', 'reactions to drugs'], ['Bilirubin', 'can be measured by', 'bilirubin test'], ['Bilirubin test', 'is used to diagnose and monitor', 'liver and bile duct diseases'], ['Bilirubin test', 'measures', 'total bilirubin'], ['Bilirubin test', 'can give levels of', 'unconjugated and conjugated bilirubin'], ['unconjugated bilirubin', 'is created from', 'red blood cell breakdown'], ['conjugated bilirubin', 'is the bilirubin once it reaches', 'liver'], ['conjugated bilirubin', 'moves to', 'intestines'], ['conjugated bilirubin', 'is removed through', 'stool']]","A bilirubin test measures the amount of bilirubin in your blood.. It's used to help find the cause of health conditions like jaundice, anemia, and liver disease.. Bilirubin is an orange-yellow pigment that occurs normally when part of your red blood cells break down.. Your liver takes the bilirubin from your blood and changes its chemical make-up so that most of it is passed through your poop as bile.. If your bilirubin levels are higher than normal, it's a sign that either your red blood cells are breaking down at an unusual rate or that your liver isn't breaking down waste properly and clearing the bilirubin from your blood.. Another option is that there's a problem somewhere along the pathway that gets the bilirubin out of your liver and into your stool.. In children and adults, doctors use it to diagnose and monitor liver and bile duct diseases.. These include cirrhosis, hepatitis, and gallstones.. It'll also help determine if you have sickle cell disease or other conditions that cause hemolytic anemia.. That's a disorder where red blood cells are destroyed faster than they're made.. High levels of bilirubin can cause a yellowing of your skin and eyes, a condition doctors call jaundice.. High bilirubin levels are common in newborns.. Doctors use the age of the newborn and the bilirubin type and levels to determine if treatment is necessary.. A nurse or lab technician will draw blood through a small needle inserted into a vein in your arm.. The blood is collected in a tube.. With newborns, blood is usually drawn by using a needle to break the skin of the heel.. Your doctor will send the blood to a lab for analysis.. Before the test, tell your doctor about how active you've been and what food and medicines you've taken.. Certain medications may alter your results.. After the test, you'll be able to continue with your normal activities right away.. Your doctor may order a bilirubin test if you: Show signs of jaundice Have anemia, or low red blood cells Might be having a toxic reaction to drugs Have a history of heavy drinking Have been exposed to hepatitis viruses Have cirrhosis You might also have your bilirubin tested if you have symptoms like: Dark urine Nausea and vomiting Abdominal pain or abdominal swelling Clay-colored stools Fatigue A bilirubin test measures total bilirubin.. It can also give levels of two different types of bilirubin: unconjugated and conjugated.. Unconjugated (âindirectâ) bilirubin.. This is the bilirubin created from red blood cell breakdown.. It travels in the blood to the liver.. Conjugated (âdirectâ) bilirubin.. This is the bilirubin once it reaches the liver and undergoes a chemical change.. It moves to the intestines before being removed through your stool.. For adults over 18, normal total bilirubin can be up to 1.2 milligrams per deciliter (mg/dl) of blood.. For those under 18, the normal level will be will be 1 mg/dl.. Normal results for conjugated (direct) bilirubin should be less than 0.3 mg/dl.. Men tend to have slightly higher bilirubin levels than women.. African- Americans tend to have lower bilirubin levels than people of other races.. High total bilirubin may be caused by: Anemia Cirrhosis A reaction to a blood transfusion Gilbert syndrome -- a common, inherited condition in which there is a deficiency of an enzyme that helps to break down bilirubin.. Viral hepatitis A reaction to drugs Alcoholic liver disease Gallstones Very strenuous exercise, such as marathon running, can increase your bilirubin levels.. Caffeine, penicillin, barbiturates, and nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs ( NSAIDs) called salicylates all lower your bilirubin levels.. Lower-than-normal levels of bilirubin aren't a problem.. In newborns, high bilirubin levels that don't level out in a few days to 2 weeks may be a sign of: Blood type incompatibility between mother and child Lack of oxygen An inherited infection A disease affecting the liver","[['Bilirubin test', 'is used to help find the cause of', 'health conditions'], ['health conditions', 'include', 'jaundice, anemia, and liver disease'], ['Bilirubin test', 'measures', 'amount of bilirubin in blood'], ['Bilirubin test', 'is performed by', 'drawing blood'], ['Bilirubin test', 'is ordered if', 'you show signs of jaundice'], ['Bilirubin test', 'is ordered if', 'you have anemia'], ['Bilirubin test', 'is ordered if', 'you might be having a toxic reaction to drugs'], ['Bilirubin test', 'is ordered if', 'you have a history of heavy drinking'], ['Bilirubin test', 'is ordered if', 'you have been exposed to hepatitis viruses'], ['Bilirubin test', 'is ordered if', 'you have cirrhosis'], ['Bilirubin test', 'is ordered if', 'you have symptoms like dark urine, nausea and vomiting, abdominal pain or abdominal swelling, clay-colored stools, fatigue']]"

Do this: Cut down on fast food, chips, hot dogs, and some microwave dinners.. Add fiber too fast.. Eating fiber from fruits, vegetables, and other foods is really important.. But add it to your diet slowly.. Too much fiber too quickly can give you painful bloating and gas.. Do this: Aim for 20-35 grams of fiber daily, but add no more than 5 grams each day.. Drink alcohol.. Booze zaps your body of fluids, which can make your stools hard -- and harder to pass.. Do this: Drink plenty of water instead.. Double down on dairy.. Lots of milk and cheese can make your constipation worse.. Do this: Kefir may be a safe choice, though.. The strains of bacteria in this fermented drink -- made with milk from cows, goats, sheep, or even soy -- may help relieve your constipation.. Skip your workout.. Not moving around enough slows food from passing through your large intestine, or colon.. That may be a root reason for your constipation.. Do this: Exercise regularly.. Rely on laxatives.. They might help in the short term.. But over time, laxatives can damage the nerve cells in your colon and interfere with muscle contractions needed to empty stools.. Laxatives can become a habit, meaning you'll need to use them before you can poop.. These medicines come in pills, liquids, suppositories, and other forms.. Do this: If your doctor thinks that laxatives might help, follow her orders about what kind to use, and try your best to limit your use.. Take certain drugs.. Many medicines can trigger constipation by slowing down stools as they travel through the body.. These include sleeping pills, painkillers, some drugs for high blood pressure, and antidepressants.. Do this: Ask your doctor if one of your meds might be causing your constipation.. Avoid the toilet.. When you're constipated, your body may need more time in the bathroom, not less.. Try to sit on the toilet for 15 minutes at the same time each day, even if you can't âgo.â It can relax your digestive system and cue your body for a bowel movement.. Do this: While on the toilet, you can try to rest your feet on a low stool or raise your knees above your hips.. Ignore your body's signals.. If you ignore that feeling that you need to go, those clues will get weaker over time.. Your bowels should be most active first thing in the morning as well as about 30 minutes after you eat.. Do this: Listen to your body's messages and head to the bathroom, even if you're busy or feel awkward using a toilet outside your home.. Fast.. You may think that cutting back on food will help âclear outâ your colon.. That's not the case.. Do this: Eating, especially healthy whole foods that contain fiber, helps your body move stool.. Forget to manage your stress.. Your colon is partly managed by your nervous system, which is like your body's electrical wiring.. If you feel stressed or anxious, your gut may feel it, too.. Do this: Talking to a therapist or learning relaxation techniques may help you feel better.. Brush off other symptoms.. Sometimes constipation can be a sign of a more serious health problem, such as colorectal cancer.. Also, not dealing with constipation early can lead to hemorrhoids, fissures or cuts in your bottom, and other complications.. Do this: If you have blood in your stool, are losing weight and don't know why, or you've been constipated for more than 3 weeks after having more fluids and fiber, call your doctor.","[['not exercising', 'can worsen', 'constipation'], ['constipation', 'characterized by', 'infrequent bowel movements'], ['infrequent bowel movements', 'can be caused by', 'lack of exercise'], ['lack of exercise', 'can lead to', 'hard, dry stools'], ['hard, dry stools', 'can cause', 'difficulty passing'], ['difficulty passing stools', 'can result in', 'discomfort'], ['regular exercise', 'beneficial for', 'maintaining healthy digestive system'], ['maintaining healthy digestive system', 'promotes', 'regular bowel movements']]"
21,What health conditions are linked to panic attacks?,"Health conditions that are linked to panic attacks include allergic reactions, heart and lung diseases, low blood sugar, asthma, and an overactive thyroid.","[['Health conditions', 'linked_to', 'panic_attacks'], ['panic_attacks', 'include', 'allergic_reactions'], ['allergic_reactions', 'type_of', 'health_conditions'], ['panic_attacks', 'include', 'heart_and_lung_diseases'], ['heart_and_lung_diseases', 'type_of', 'health_conditions'], ['panic_attacks', 'include', 'low_blood_sugar'], ['low_blood_sugar', 'type_of', 'health_conditions'], ['panic_attacks', 'include', 'asthma'], ['asthma', 'type_of', 'health_conditions'], ['panic_attacks', 'include', 'overactive_thyroid'], ['overactive_thyroid', 'type_of', 'health_conditions']]","A panic attack can be mistaken for various health conditions due to the similarity of their symptoms. However, it's rare for a panic attack to last over an hour. If you're experiencing a prolonged attack, it may be due to waves of panic attacks, aftereffects of a single panic attack, or another health condition such as generalized anxiety disorder, allergic reactions, heart and lung diseases, or conditions that trigger panic attacks in individuals prone to them. It's essential to consult a healthcare professional for accurate diagnosis and treatment.","[['panic_attack', 'can_be_mistaken_for', 'health_conditions'], ['health_conditions', 'include', 'generalized_anxiety_disorder'], ['generalized_anxiety_disorder', 'type_of', 'health_conditions'], ['panic_attack', 'symptoms', 'last_for_more_than_an_hour'], ['panic_attack', 'symptoms', 'include'], ['waves_of_panic_attacks', 'occur_after', 'single_panic_attack'], ['panic_attack', 'symptoms', 'include'], ['allergic_reactions', 'type_of', 'health_conditions_that_can_trigger_panic_attacks'], ['heart_and_lung_diseases', 'type_of', 'health_conditions_that_can_trigger_panic_attacks']]","If you get a panic attack, it usually lasts 20 to 30 minutes, hitting its peak at about 10 minutes in.. So what's going on if it seems to you like your panic attack just won't end?. To figure out the possible reasons it feels this way, it helps to understand what's happening during a panic attack.. When you have one, it triggers your ""fight or flight"" response, which is how your body reacts when your physical safety is threatened.. You get a rush of adrenaline that amps you up so you can make a split-second decision to run or fight.. This response isn't meant to last very long and soon burns itself out.. That's why panic attacks that last as long as an hour aren't very common.. What's the story with a panic attack that seems to go and on?. If that's happening to you, it's likely one of three things: Waves of panic attacks Aftereffects of a single panic attack Another health condition If you have panic attack symptoms for an hour or more, you may really be having a wave of panic attacks, one after another.. There's actually a period of recovery between them, though you may not notice it.. The overall effect feels like you're being hit with one never-ending attack.. It's rare that this happens, though.. The fight or flight response is so draining, it's hard to set it off that often.. A more likely possibility is that you had a single panic attack that leaves you feeling generally anxious, tired, and frayed.. While panic attacks can be scary, they're not dangerous.. But the fear they may cause you can be more unsettling than the attack itself.. That's especially true if you've never had one before.. When it's your first episode, you may think you're having a stroke or a heart attack.. How do you tell if it's a panic attack or high anxiety?. It's tricky.. It helps to talk to your doctor, but a closer look at your symptoms often can give you some clues.. A true panic attack tends to have clear, intense, physical symptoms -- a pounding heart, shortness of breath, and so on.. Anxiety can give you some of these, but they tend to be milder.. Instead, you'll have more mental symptoms like a racing mind, lots of worries you can't stop, and a hard time focusing.. You might also feel restless and have a hard time sleeping.. The condition that most closely mirrors a longer panic attack is generalized anxiety disorder.. This is where you have a hard time controlling your worry, and you struggle to keep your anxiety in check.. But one of the challenges with panic attacks, long or short, is that the same symptoms happen with a wide range of other health conditions, including allergic reactions and heart and lung diseases.. And if you have a tendency to panic, some health problems -- like low blood sugar, asthma, or an overactive thyroid -- can trigger a full-blown panic attack.. Keep in mind that typically, people mistake a panic attack for another health condition, not the other way around.. Just because you're having a long panic attack, it doesn't mean you have something else going on.. But it's worth checking it out with your doctor.","[['panic_attack', 'lasts', '20_to_30_minutes'], ['panic_attack', 'triggers', 'fight_or_flight_response'], ['fight_or_flight_response', 'response_to', 'physical_safety_threat'], ['panic_attack', 'symptoms', 'include'], ['generalized_anxiety_disorder', 'type_of', 'another_health_condition']]"

Many of the causes of high-output heart failure are curable.. It's a good idea to treat the underlying cause first.. Your doctor may suggest other treatments, including a diet low in salt and water..

Some take less time, are safer, and are easier on your body.. Others target the specific glitch in your cells that allows the cancer to survive or grow.. But no matter which one you and your doctor choose, the goal is the same: get rid of the cancer so it doesn't come back.. To start, you and your doctor will want to know: The type of breast cancer you have The size of your tumor and how far the cancer has spread in your body, called the stage of your disease How fast it will grow How likely the cancer is to spread or come back after treatment How well certain therapies will work for you Your age and how healthy you are The option you'd prefer These details will help your doctor recommend some treatments that could work well for you.. The most common treatments for breast cancer are: Surgery.. For most people, the first step is to take out the tumor.. An operation called lumpectomy removes only the part of your breast that has cancer.. Sometimes it's called breast-conserving surgery.. In a mastectomy, doctors remove the whole breast.. Be sure to discuss the pros and cons of both types of surgery with your doctor.. Often, removal of your whole breast does not work better or help you live longer.. Radiation.. This treatment uses high-energy waves to kill cancer cells.. Most women under age 70 who have a lumpectomy get radiation, too.. That helps destroy any cancer cells that the surgeon couldn't remove.. Doctors also might recommend this method if the disease has spread.. Radiation can come from a machine outside your body.. Or you can get tiny seeds that give off radiation placed inside your breast where the tumor was.. In the past, people had radiation every day for many weeks.. But it works just as well to get the same total amount of radiation in less time.. It's also safer and causes fewer side effects.. Ask your doctor if shorter therapy is an option for you.. Chemotherapy.. During chemo, you take drugs as pills or through an IV to treat the disease throughout your body.. Most people get it after surgery to kill any cancer cells left behind.. Doctors also prescribe it before surgery to make tumors smaller.. Chemo works well against cancer, but it also can harm healthy cells.. This can cause side effects such as hair loss, mouth sores, and nausea.. Hormone therapy.. In some breast cancers, the hormones estrogen and progesterone can make cancer cells grow.. This treatment blocks these hormones.. Targeted therapy.. These fight the changes in cells that lead to cancer.. For instance, some cells have too much of a type of protein, which makes them grow too much.. Drugs can block how these proteins work.. Targeted treatments often have fewer side effects than those that affect the whole body, like chemo.. Most breast cancer treatments cause side effects.. Many, like nausea, go away when the therapy stops.. But some may show up later.. They're called late effects, and they include: Symptoms of menopause, such as hot flashes Trouble getting pregnant Depression Trouble sleeping Changes in the way your breast looks Trouble thinking clearly (""chemo brain"") You and your doctor will decide on your treatment together..

No salmon, eel, tuna, herring, or dried or pickled fish are allowed.. Vegetable choices include spinach, chard, chicory, beet greens, green salad, tomatoes, celery, fennel, onions, red radishes, cucumbers, asparagus, and cabbage.. Bread can be one breadstick or one piece of melba toast.. For fruit, you can choose an orange, an apple, a handful of strawberries, or half a grapefruit.. The diet allows as much water, coffee, and tea as you want.. You can also have up to 1 tablespoon of milk per day.. You can use sugar substitutes but not sugar to sweeten drinks.. Butter and oils aren't allowed.. It's very hard to stick with the strict calorie limit.. Not only is it uncomfortable to live on just 500 calories a day, it can be dangerous..

Subtle clues of fuzzy thinking include struggling to find words, forgetting tasks, or having trouble concentrating. While MS usually does not hurt intelligence or long-term memory, it's essential to discuss any cognitive concerns with your doctor, who can rule out normal aging or drug-related causes and provide appropriate testing and treatment options, such as memory exercises, organizational tools, or cognitive rehabilitation. In rare cases, severe thinking problems may require constant care or assisted living arrangements. Research is ongoing to explore medications and treatments that may improve memory and focus in MS.","[['MS', 'can cause', 'cognitive difficulties'], ['cognitive difficulties', 'may include', 'poor focus'], ['cognitive difficulties', 'may include', 'slowed thinking'], ['cognitive difficulties', 'may include', 'fuzzy memory'], ['MS', 'can affect', 'around 5-10%'], ['MS', 'can require', 'assisted living arrangements'], ['MS', 'does not usually hurt', 'intelligence'], ['MS', 'does not usually hurt', 'long-term memory']]","When you've got multiple sclerosis, losing your keys or forgetting a name can be scary.. You wonder whether the illness is clouding your thinking.. It's true that over time, about half of people with MS can have some cognitive problems.. That means poor focus, slowed thinking, or a fuzzy memory.. Often these problems are mild and don't really interrupt your daily life.. It's pretty rare to have severe thinking problems.. They affect about 5% to 10% of people with MS.. The clues that you have fuzzy thinking are often subtle.. You might not notice them until a friend, co-worker, or family member points them out.. You may: Struggle to find the right words to say Forget things you need to do or tasks already done Find it hard to plan ahead or set priorities Have trouble concentrating, especially when two things are happening at once.. MS usually does not hurt your intelligence or long-term memory.. It won't change your ability to read and carry on a conversation.. If you think you have cognitive problems, talk with your neurologist or family doctor.. Fuzzy thinking can have many causes.. Your doctor can make sure your problems don't come from normal aging or drugs that may cause confusion, depression, anxiety, or fatigue.. Once you have any health problems fully treated, the next step is usually testing.. Your doctor may refer you to a neuropsychologist, speech pathologist, or occupational therapist.. If test results show that MS is to blame for spotty memory or poor mental focus, you may want to try rehab to sharpen your thinking.. This can include: Memory exercises on a computer Home or work strategies with notebooks, organizers, or filing systems to help you remember things It's possible, but rare, that thinking problems become so severe that someone with MS needs constant care or can't live on their own.. If this becomes an issue, discuss your options with your doctor and family.. A social worker or psychologist can also help explore options for care.. Scientists are doing studies to see whether the drugs that slow the nerve damage in MS -- called disease-modifying medicines -- can help with thinking problems, too.. Others are looking at treatments, such as Alzheimer's medications, that may temporarily improve your memory and focus.. Ask your doctor to give you updates on any promising results.","[['MS', 'can cause', 'fuzzy thinking'], ['fuzzy thinking', 'can include', 'struggling to find words'], ['fuzzy thinking', 'can include', 'forgetting tasks'], ['fuzzy thinking', 'can include', 'trouble concentrating'], ['MS', 'can affect', 'around 50%'], ['MS', 'can require', 'testing'], ['testing', 'can be conducted by', 'neurologist'], ['testing', 'can be conducted by', 'family doctor'], ['test results', 'can show', 'MS as cause'], ['MS', 'can be treated', 'health problems'], ['MS', 'can be treated', 'normal aging'], ['MS', 'can be treated', 'drugs'], ['rehab', 'can help', 'sharpen thinking'], ['rehab', 'can include', 'memory exercises'], ['rehab', 'can include', 'home or work strategies'], ['MS', 'can be studied', 'disease-modifying medicines'], ['MS', 'can be studied', ""Alzheimer's medications""]]"

Still, it's not always easy for doctors to diagnose your condition.. The classic symptoms of EPI -- weight loss, greasy and foul-smelling stools that float or are tough to flush, stomach cramps, and diarrhea -- mimic the telltale signs of many other digestive diseases.. You might even have one of those diseases along with EPI, like Crohn's or celiac disease.. That makes it hard for doctors to know exactly which condition is causing you trouble.. To add to the confusion, not everyone with EPI has the same classic symptoms.. Other warning signs can be too subtle for you to notice.. To figure out what's going on, your doctor will use tests to see how many nutrients your body is absorbing from food.. Here's a rundown of the tests she might use.. Blood work.. Your doctor will take a sample of your blood and send it to a lab to check it for anemia, a condition in which your body doesn't have enough healthy red blood cells.. The lab will also test your blood for vitamin B12, iron, and folate.. If the levels are too low, that can mean EPI is keeping your body from absorbing these nutrients.. The lab might also look for a chemical your pancreas makes to help with digestion called trypsinogen.. A level that's too high is a sign of a problem.. Fecal elastase test.. You'll give your doctor a solid stool sample.. The lab will check it for an enzyme your pancreas makes to help your body digest protein, called elastase.. If you have EPI, the amount might be less concentrated than normal.. 3-day fecal test.. You'll need to collect samples of your stool in special containers for about 3 days and give them to your doctor.. The lab will test them for the amount of fat they have.. CT scan.. This machine looks like a giant doughnut.. It takes special X-rays that show your tissues and blood vessels, along with your bones.. You'll lie on a padded table that slides you up so the machine is over your upper tummy.. The doctor may take one set of images and then ask you to drink a kind of dye (they'll call it contrast) to get a better picture of the area.. Tell your doctor if you've had a bad reaction to the dye in the past or if you're allergic to shellfish, like shrimp, crab, lobster, oysters, scallops, clams, or mussels.. A basic scan takes about 10-15 minutes, but if you need contrast, you'll be there longer.. Endoscopic ultrasound.. Your doctor might need to take a closer look at your pancreas and other organs to see if they're damaged or inflamed.. In a hospital, doctors will put a thin tube in your mouth, down through your stomach, and into the first part of your small intestine.. At the tip is an ultrasound probe that gives off sound waves.. They help make a picture of the inside of your body, which doctors can see on a screen.. You might be asleep or awake for the test, but you'll get medicine to make you more comfortable.. The test usually takes 20 to 45 minutes, and you won't need to stay in the hospital overnight.. During this test, your doctor can also take a small piece of your tissue to study under a microscope -- if he needs one.. MRI and MRCP.. The MRI machine uses a magnet to take detailed pictures of your insides.. You'll lie on a padded table, and it will slide until your upper belly is under the magnet.. You'll be awake for it, but if you get anxious in small, tight spaces, the doctor might give you a drug to help you relax.. You won't have to stay overnight in the hospital.. An MRCP is a special kind of MRI that focuses on your bile ducts and ducts in your pancreas.. The MRI takes about 35 minutes.. The MRCP takes about 10 minutes.","[['Blood tests', 'used for', 'diagnosis of EPI'], ['Blood tests', 'check for', 'anemia'], ['Blood tests', 'check for', 'vitamin B12 deficiency'], ['Blood tests', 'check for', 'iron deficiency'], ['Blood tests', 'check for', 'folate deficiency'], ['Blood tests', 'check for', 'elevated trypsinogen level'], ['EPI', 'causes', 'classic symptoms'], ['EPI', 'causes', 'classic symptoms'], ['EPI', 'causes', 'classic symptoms'], ['EPI', 'causes', 'classic symptoms'], ['EPI', 'causes', 'subtle symptoms'], ['Doctor', 'performs', 'tests'], ['Tests', 'help', 'determine'], ['Blood work', 'tested by', 'doctor'], ['Blood work', 'tests for', 'anemia'], ['Blood work', 'tests for', 'vitamin B12 deficiency'], ['Blood work', 'tests for', 'iron deficiency'], ['Blood work', 'tests for', 'folate deficiency'], ['Blood work', 'tests for', 'elevated trypsinogen'], ['Fecal elastase test', 'tests for', 'elastase'], ['3-day fecal test', 'tests for', 'amount of fat'], ['CT scan', 'used for', 'imaging'], ['Endoscopic ultrasound', 'used for', 'closer look at organs'], ['MRI and MRCP', 'used for', 'imaging']]"

In a survey of people with depression and bipolar disorder conducted by the Depression and Bipolar Support Alliance, 88% said their condition affected their ability to work.. But don't be alarmed.. A diagnosis of bipolar disorder doesn't necessarily mean that you can't keep your job.. Plenty of people with bipolar disorder work and live normal lives.. You don't have to talk to your boss or coworkers about your bipolar disorder.. Your health is your personal, private business.. But if your condition has been affecting your performance at work, being open may be a good idea.. Your boss and coworkers may have noticed the changes in your behavior.. If you explain what's going on, they may be more sympathetic and helpful than you expect.. Some people with bipolar disorder find their current job just isn't a good fit.. Maybe it's too stressful or the schedule is too inflexible.. Maybe it doesn't let them get enough sleep, or involves shift work that could worsen their condition.. If you think your job is hurting your health, it's time to make some changes.. Here are some things to consider: Decide what you really need from your job.. Do you need to reduce your responsibilities?. Do you need extra breaks during the day to reduce stress, or need time off during the work week to keep doctor or therapist appointments?. Make decisions carefully.. People with bipolar disorder are prone to acting impulsively.. Think through the effects of quitting your job -- both for yourself and possibly for your family.. Talk over your feelings with your family, therapist, or health care provider.. Look into financial assistance.. If you do need to take time off because of your bipolar disorder, see if your employer has disability insurance, or look into Social Security Disability Insurance, which will provide some income while you recover.. You can also look into the Family and Medical Leave Act.. Ask your doctor or therapist for advice.. Go slowly.. Returning to work after you've taken time off can be stressful.. Think about starting in a part-time position, at least until you're confident that your bipolar disorder has stabilized.. Some people find that volunteer work is a good way to get back into the swing of things..

Such tingling can sometimes be benign and temporary.. For example, it could result from pressure on nerves when your arm is crooked under your head as you fall asleep.. Or it could be from pressure on nerves when you cross your legs too long.. In either case, the ""pins and needles"" effect -- which is usually painless -- is soon relieved by removing the pressure that caused it.. var s_context; s_context= s_context || {}; s_context['wb.modimp'] = 'vidfloat'; if(webmd.useragent && webmd.useragent.ua.type === 'desktop'){ webmd.ads2.disable Initial Load(); webmd.ads2.disable Ads Init = true; $(function() { webmd.p.pim.increment(); $('.responsive-video-container').insert After('.module-social-share-container'); require(['video2/1/responsive-player/video-loader'], function(video Loader) { video Loader.init({ autoplay: webmd.useragent.ua.type === 'desktop' && !. !s_sensitive, chron ID: $('article embeded_module[type=video][align=top]:eq(0)').attr('chronic_id'), continuous Play: true, cp Options: { flyout: true }, display Ads: true, mode: 'in-article', sticky: true }) }); }); } else { $(function(){ $('.responsive-video-container').remove(); }); } In many cases, however, tingling in the hands, feet, or both can be severe, episodic, or chronic.. It also can accompany other symptoms.. such as pain, itching, numbness, and muscle wasting.. In such cases, tingling may be a sign of nerve damage, which can result from causes as varied as traumatic injuries or repetitive stress injuries, bacterial or viral infections, toxic exposures, and systemic diseases such as diabetes.. Such nerve damage is known as peripheral neuropathy because it affects nerves distant from the brain and spinal cord, often in the hands and feet.. There are more than 100 different types of peripheral neuropathy.. Over time, peripheral neuropathy can worsen, resulting in decreased mobility and even disability.. More than 20 million Americans, most of them older adults, are estimated to have peripheral neuropathy.. It's important to seek prompt medical evaluation for any persistent tingling in your hands, feet, or both.. The earlier the underlying cause of your tingling is identified and brought under control, the less likely you are to suffer potentially lifelong consequences.. Diabetes is one of the most common causes of peripheral neuropathy, accounting for about 30% of cases.. In diabetic neuropathy, tingling and other symptoms often first develop in both feet and go up the legs, followed by tingling and other symptoms that affect both hands and go up the arms.. About two-thirds of people with diabetes have mild to severe forms of nerve damage.. In many cases, these symptoms are the first signs of diabetes.. In another 30% of peripheral neuropathy cases, the cause is unknown or ""idiopathic."". The remaining 40% of cases have a variety of causes such as: Nerve entrapment syndromes.. These include carpal tunnel syndrome, ulnar nerve palsy, peroneal nerve palsy, and radial nerve palsy.. Systemic diseases.. These include kidney disorders, liver disease, vascular damage and blood diseases, amyloidosis, connective tissue disorders and chronic inflammation, hormonal imbalances (including hypothyroidism), and cancers and benign tumors that impinge on nerves.. Vitamin deficiencies.. Vitamins E, B1, B6, B12, and niacin are essential for healthy nerve function.. A B12 deficiency, for example, can lead to pernicious anemia, an important cause of peripheral neuropathy.. But too much B6 also can cause tingling in the hands and feet.. Alcoholism.. Alcoholics are more likely to have a thiamine or other important vitamin deficiencies because of poor dietary habits, a common cause of peripheral neuropathy.. It's also possible that alcoholism itself can cause nerve damage, a condition that some researchers call alcoholic neuropathy.. Toxins.. These include heavy metals such as lead, arsenic, mercury, and thallium, and some industrial and environmental chemicals.. They also include certain medications -- especially chemotherapy drugs used for lung cancer -- but also some antiviral and antibiotic drugs.. Infections.. These include Lyme disease, shingles (varicella-zoster), cytomegalovirus, Epstein- Barr, herpes simplex, and HIV/ AIDS.. Autoimmune diseases.. These include chronic inflammatory demyelinating polyneuropathy, Guillain- Barre syndrome, lupus, and rheumatoid arthritis.. Inherited disorders.. These include a group which may have sensory and motor symptoms, the most common type is known as Charcot- Marie- Tooth disease.. Injury.. Often related to trauma, nerves can be compressed, crushed, or damaged, resulting in nerve pain.. Examples include nerve compression caused by a herniated disc or dislocated bone.. If you seek care for your tingling hands or feet, your health care provider will do a physical exam and take an extensive medical history addressing your symptoms, work environment, social habits (including alcohol use), toxic exposure, risk of HIV or other infectious diseases, and family history of neurological disease.. He or she also may perform additional tests such as: Blood tests.. These can include tests to detect diabetes, vitamin deficiencies, liver or kidney dysfunction, other metabolic disorders, and signs of abnormal immune system activity.. An examination of cerebrospinal fluid.. This can identify antibodies associated with peripheral neuropathy.. An electromyogram ( EMG), a test of the electrical activity of muscle Nerve conduction velocity ( NCV) Other tests may include: Computed tomography ( CT) Magnetic resonance imaging ( MRI) Nerve biopsy Skin biopsy to look at nerve fiber endings Successful treatment depends on an accurate diagnosis and treatment of the underlying cause of the tingling.. As long as the peripheral nerve cells have not been killed, they have the ability to regenerate.. Although no treatments are available for inherited types of peripheral neuropathy, many of the acquired types can be improved with treatment.. For example, good blood sugar control in diabetes can slow the progression of diabetic neuropathy; vitamin supplementation can correct peripheral neuropathy in people with vitamin deficiencies.. General lifestyle recommendations include maintaining an optimal weight, avoiding exposure to toxins, following a doctor-supervised exercise program, eating a balanced diet, and avoiding or limiting alcohol consumption.. Recommendations also include quitting smoking, which constricts blood supply to blood vessels supplying nutrients to peripheral nerves.. In some cases, tingling and other symptoms of peripheral neuropathy may be reduced with prescriptions originally developed for treating seizures and depression.","[['Alcoholism', 'is_a_risk_factor_for', 'peripheral_neuropathy'], ['peripheral_neuropathy', 'can_be_caused_by', 'vitamin_deficiencies'], ['vitamin_deficiencies', 'can_be_caused_by', 'alcoholism']]"

Whether you've got a hacking cough or feel short of breath, treatments can make a big difference.. There's no cure, but medication and other kinds of therapy can ease your symptoms and make your life easier.. Some new drugs may help slow down the disease.. They can prevent more scar tissue from forming in your lungs.. Other treatments help you breathe more easily, control your cough, give you more energy, or prevent infections that could make you sicker.. The options you pick depend on your specific symptoms, overall health, and age.. Talk to your doctor to figure out the best plan so you can enjoy your life and stay active.. Two drugs may help prevent new scarring from forming in your lungs, which is the cause of your breathing troubles.. Nintedanib ( Ofev) and pirfenidone ( Esbriet) block a process in your body that leads to lung scarring.. They may keep your IPF from getting worse and can help you breathe better.. Other medications fight the inflammation that makes you feel sick or causes scarring.. Your doctor may suggest: Corticosteroids like prednisone Drugs that slow down your immune system, like azathioprine ( Imuran), cyclophosphamide ( Cytoxan), and mycophenolate mofetil ( Cell Cept) Drugs may treat your IPF scarring or symptoms, but you can do other things to breathe better and get more energy.. Oxygen therapy.. It helps you feel less short of breath so you can stay active.. You'll carry a small, light oxygen tank with you and breathe in through a small tube in your nose.. Pulmonary rehab.. You do exercises to help your breathing and build up your strength.. Your therapist can give you tips for a healthy diet so you keep your weight and energy levels up.. He can also show you how to save your energy for when you need it most.. If your IPF scarring is severe, your doctor may suggest a lung transplant.. Most people only think about doing this if other treatments aren't working.. Most people who get lung transplants are younger than 65.. But if you're older and have no other serious medical problems, it may be an option for you.. It's a major operation.. There aren't many lungs available from donors, so you'll go on a list to receive one.. While you wait, avoid smoking, eat a healthy diet, do your breathing exercises, and stay as active as possible.. Once you get word that a donor has been found, you may have to go to the hospital quickly for your surgery, so make sure your doctor can reach you at all times.. You won't be awake during your surgery.. Doctors put tubes into your mouth and windpipe that help you breathe while it's going on.. During the operation, your surgeon removes your lung and the blood vessels that connect it to your heart.. He then attaches your new lung to these blood vessels.. If you're getting two new lungs, you'll need a heart-lung bypass machine to pump oxygen into your blood during the surgery.. A single lung transplant takes 4-8 hours, and a double transplant takes 6-12 hours.. After surgery, you'll recover in the hospital for up to 3 weeks.. You'll need to cough to clear fluid from your lungs.. You'll also do breathing exercises to learn to take slow, deep breaths.. For 3 months after your surgery, your doctor will test your blood and lungs to make sure your body doesn't reject your new lung or you don't get any infections.. You'll take medicines for the rest of your life to help prevent this from happening.. It can take weeks or months to recover.. If you're thinking about getting a transplant, you'll need a lot of emotional support.. Ask your doctor about support groups that have people facing the same concerns as you.. Also find out about educational workshops that can explain what to expect before and after surgery.","[['Symptoms of IPF', 'can be eased with', 'treatments'], [""There's no cure for IPF"", 'but medication and other kinds of therapy can', 'make life easier'], ['Inflammation causing symptoms or scarring', 'can be treated with', 'corticosteroids'], ['Oxygen therapy', 'helps IPF patients', 'feel less short of breath'], ['Lung transplant', 'requires', 'tubes to help patient breathe during surgery']]"

But if you take too much, it can hurt your liver.. In extreme cases, it can even cause liver failure.. It's still fine to use acetaminophen.. You just need to know how to do that safely.. More than 50 million Americans use acetaminophen each week.. It's the most widely used drug ingredient in the U. S., found in more than 600 prescription and over-the-counter (â OTCâ) medications, including allergy pills, cold medicines, cough syrups, headache pills, and sleep aids.. Never take more than one product at a time that's made with acetaminophen.. For instance, if it's in your headache pill and your cold medicine, and you take them both, you could get more than you should.. Check the â Active Ingredientsâ section of the â Drug Factsâ box on your OTC medication, or the label on your prescription, where it may be called â APAPâ or âacetam.â Read the label on your medication.. Don't take more than directed, even if you're still in pain or don't feel well.. Even when you stick to the recommended dose, you shouldn't take acetaminophen for more than 10 days for pain, or 3 days for fever.. If you still feel like you need relief, call your doctor, nurse, or pharmacist.. Adults should not get more than 4,000 milligrams of acetaminophen per day from all sources.. That's no more than 12 regular-strength pills at 325 milligrams per pill, or 8 extra-strength pills at 500 milligrams per pill.. For children, the daily limit depends on their weight and age.. Check how many milligrams are in your child's doses, and follow the directions on the label exactly.. You may need to switch your child's weight from pounds to kilograms -- you can use an online calculator to do that.. If you're not sure how much is OK, ask your doctor or pharmacist.. To help you keep track, write down all the medicines you give your child each day.. Common reasons people mistakenly pass the daily limit include: They take too much at once.. They don't wait long enough between doses.. If you have more than three alcoholic drinks a day or have liver disease, ask your doctor before you take anything that has acetaminophen in it.. In these cases, even the recommended dose could make liver damage more likely.. If you think you may have accidentally taken too much acetaminophen, you may have: Nausea Loss of appetite Vomiting Sweating Diarrhea These symptoms may not start until hours after you've taken the drug..

Over time, the replacement joint may become loose or separate from the bone, requiring additional surgery.","[['Shoulder replacement surgery', 'may result in', 'infection'], ['Shoulder replacement surgery', 'may result in', 'bleeding'], ['Shoulder replacement surgery', 'may result in', 'dislocation'], ['Shoulder replacement surgery', 'may result in', 'nerve damage'], ['Shoulder replacement surgery', 'may result in', 'loosening or separation of replacement joint'], ['infection', 'around', 'joint'], ['bleeding', 'around', 'joint'], ['dislocation', 'of', 'shoulder replacement joint'], ['nerve damage', 'around', 'shoulder'], ['loosening or separation of replacement joint', 'from', 'bone']]","If your shoulder joint gets seriously damaged, you might need surgery to replace it.. Before you have your procedure, you should know some things.. The joint where your upper arm connects to your body is a ball-and-socket joint.. The bone in your upper arm, called the humerus, has a round end that fits into the curved structure on the outside of your shoulder blade.. Ligaments and tendons hold it together.. Ligaments connect the bones, while tendons connect muscles to the bone.. A layer of tissue called cartilage keeps the bones apart, so they don't rub against each other.. The ball and socket lets you move your arm up and down, back and forward, or in a circle.. You may have to have it done if you have a condition that makes it painful and hard to use your arm, such as: A serious shoulder injury like a broken bone Severe arthritis A torn rotator cuff Your doctor will probably try to treat you with drugs or physical therapy first.. If those don't work, he may recommend surgery.. Shoulder replacement surgery is less common than hip or knee replacements.. But more than 50,000 shoulder replacements are done in the U. S. each year.. An orthopedic surgeon will replace the natural bone in the ball and socket of your shoulder joint with a material that could be metal or plastic.. It's a major surgery that'll keep you in the hospital for several days.. You'll also need several weeks of physical therapy afterward.. There are three types of shoulder replacement surgeries: Total shoulder replacement: This is the most common type.. It replaces the ball at the top of your humerus with a metal ball, which gets attached to the remaining bone.. The socket gets covered with a new plastic surface.. Partial shoulder replacement: Only the ball gets replaced.. Reverse shoulder replacement: Usually, you'd get this if you have a torn rotator cuff.. It's also done when another shoulder replacement surgery didn't work.. The metal ball gets attached to your shoulder bones, and a socket is implanted at the top of your arm.. Before you get your new shoulder, you'll likely get a full physical exam and X-rays or other imaging tests so the surgeon can get a look at the joint.. Talk to your doctor about any other conditions you have and any medications you take.. You'll have to stop taking certain drugs, especially narcotic painkillers, several weeks before surgery.. You may have to cut back on drinking and get more exercise, too.. If you smoke, you'll be asked to quit.. Scientists have found folks who smoke are more likely to have complications from joint replacement surgery than those who don't.. Don't eat or drink anything after midnight on the night before your operation.. The procedure takes about 3 hours.. Doctors will give you drugs to put you under during the surgery.. You'll want to be sure you have some help with your daily routine lined up for a few weeks after you come home from the hospital.. You won't be able to move your arm very much.. If you don't have a relative or friend who can help you out, you might want to check into a rehabilitation center until you can do more things on your own.. You may also want to move some things around at home to make them easier to get to while you recover.. You can expect to spend 2 to 5 days in the hospital after your operation before going home.. Your shoulder will swell, and it will hurt.. Your doctor will prescribe drugs to help you manage the pain.. Cold compresses can help control the swelling.. At first, your arm will be in a brace to keep it from moving.. Within a day or so, you'll start physical therapy to get your arm and your new shoulder working.. You'll keep doing physical therapy after you go home.. You'll do exercises that will gradually improve how your new joint works.. Don't rush things: It may take 4 weeks before you can pick up anything heavier than a glass of water.. Your arm will be in a sling for most of your recovery.. It may be 6 weeks or more before you can drive again.. In the year after your surgery, you'll have several follow-up visits with your doctor so she can see how your recovery is going.. Most people have full motion in their shoulder and return to their daily routine after joint replacement surgery.. But as with any operation, there's a chance of complications.. These may include: Infection or bleeding around the joint: You'll probably get antibiotics after your surgery to lower your chances of an infection.. Dislocation: This happens when the ball slips out of the socket.. Nerves around your shoulder may get damaged during surgery: They usually recover.. After years of use, the replacement joint may become loose or separate from the bone: You may need surgery to fix it.","[['Shoulder replacement surgery', 'may require', 'additional surgery'], ['additional surgery', 'for', 'loose or separated replacement joint'], ['replacement joint', 'may become', 'loose or separated'], ['loose or separated replacement joint', 'requires', 'surgery'], ['shoulder joint', 'consists of', 'ball-and-socket joint'], ['humerus', 'is', 'bone in upper arm'], ['humerus', 'has', 'round end'], ['shoulder blade', 'has', 'curved structure'], ['ligaments', 'connect', 'bones'], ['tendons', 'connect', 'muscles to bone'], ['cartilage', 'keeps', 'bones apart'], ['ball and socket', 'lets', 'move arm'], ['ball and socket', 'consists of', 'ball'], ['ball', 'attached to', 'remaining bone'], ['socket', 'covered with', 'new plastic surface'], ['ball', 'replaced with', 'metal ball'], ['socket', 'replaced with', 'new plastic surface'], ['total shoulder replacement', 'replaces', 'ball at top of humerus'], ['total shoulder replacement', 'attaches', 'metal ball to remaining bone'], ['partial shoulder replacement', 'replaces', 'ball'], ['reverse shoulder replacement', 'attaches', 'metal ball to shoulder bones'], ['reverse shoulder replacement', 'implants', 'socket at top of arm'], ['condition', 'makes', 'painful and hard to use arm'], ['condition', 'requires', 'surgery'], ['serious shoulder injury', 'like', 'broken bone'], ['severe arthritis', 'a', 'condition'], ['torn rotator cuff', 'a', 'condition'], ['doctor', 'recommends', 'surgery'], ['shoulder replacement surgery', 'less common than', 'hip or knee replacements'], ['shoulder replacement surgery', 'done in U.S.', 'each year'], ['orthopedic surgeon', 'replaces', 'natural bone'], ['shoulder replacement surgery', 'keeps', 'patient in hospital'], ['shoulder replacement surgery', 'requires', 'physical therapy'], ['total shoulder replacement', 'replaces', 'ball at top of humerus'], ['total shoulder replacement', 'attaches', 'metal ball to remaining bone'], ['partial shoulder replacement', 'replaces', 'ball'], ['reverse shoulder replacement', 'attaches', 'metal ball to shoulder bones'], ['reverse shoulder replacement', 'implants', 'socket at top of arm'], ['full physical exam', 'part of', 'pre-surgery process'], ['X-rays or other imaging tests', 'part of', 'pre-surgery process'], ['doctor', 'examines', 'joint'], ['doctor', 'recommends', 'drugs or physical therapy'], ['drugs or physical therapy', 'tried before', 'surgery'], ['shoulder replacement surgery', 'less common than', 'hip or knee replacements'], ['50,000', 'number of', 'shoulder replacements'], ['hospital stay', 'lasts for', 'several days'], ['physical therapy', 'required after', 'surgery']]"

While there's no cure, treatments are available, including medications and dietary modifications. Learning as much as you can about IBS, talking openly with your doctor, and tracking your symptoms in a journal can help you take control. Seeking support from trusted family, friends, and support groups can also make a difference.

While there is no cure for the disorder, treatments are available.. Learn as much as you can about the syndrome.. It helps to talk with your doctor.. Ask him or her any questions you may have about the disorder, no matter how embarrassing it might be.. The more you know about your condition and the type of IBS you have, the better you can deal with it.. Also, read books, pamphlets, and reliable sources of information on the Internet.. Try the International Foundation for Functional Gastrointestinal Disorders ( IFFGD) at www.iffgd.org, or call the organization at (414) 964-1799.. You can find information about IBS, health care provider directories, and support networks.. Keeping track of your symptoms is another helpful tool.. In a symptom journal, record when and where you experienced any stomach pain, discomfort, bloating, diarrhea, or constipation.. Also include what you were doing, how you were feeling, and what type of food or medications you consumed before and when symptoms appeared.. All this information may help you and your doctor determine what triggers your IBS.. Then you can take reasonable steps such as dietary modification toprevent problems and take control of your life.. Remember, you don't have to be alone in dealing with IBS.. Seek out support from trusted family and friends. "". They could be your best resource,"" says Jeffrey Roberts, founder of the IBS Patient Support Group.. Roberts, who manages his own IBS, says there are times when the disorder makes him and his family late for an event because he needs to use the bathroom.. Because they know about his condition, they are more understanding.. At work, talking to a trusted supervisor or co-worker may make it easier for you to deal with the disorder.. Let them know that you have a valid chronic illness, and when symptoms flare up, you have no control over it, suggests Roberts.. This might mean bringing in educational materials about the disorder.. At the same time, tell them that you've got a plan to deal with the syndrome (such as taking medication or going to the bathroom a few times), and that, despite it all, you'll remain a dedicated worker.. If you have a problem with your union or boss, it might help to get a note from your doctor, explaining the illness and what might occur with symptoms.. You may well find that most people are more supportive if you're honest with them, says Lynn Jacks, founder of an IBS support group in Summit, N. J.. There are other sources of support if you don't feel comfortable talking with people you know.. There are doctors, nurse practitioners, therapists, and dietitians who specialize in IBS and can give you valuable feedback.. Ask your doctor if he or she knows of any IBS support groups.. The IBS Patient Support Group has meetings online at www.ibspatient.org.. Coping with IBS also takes some preparation and courage. "". You don't have to be afraid to go out,"" says Jacks.. She says people may feel more comfortable if they do a little research before going to an event. "". Know where the public restroom is."". For instance, if you're going to a wedding, concert, or movie, sit at the back or end of the row for easy access to the facilities.. If you go to a dinner, find out what's on the menu so that you can eat beforehand should the fare be something that would be disagreeable.. Accepting embarrassing situations may also help, says Jacks. "". You have to be honest and say, ' Sorry, but I have an illness.'"". She adds: If you don't tell people, they may imagine reasons for your behavior that are stranger than IBS.. And remember, it's human to have embarrassments.. Situations may not be as bad as you think.. You may find other people have not noticed your trips to the bathroom or that they're dealing with their own awkward issues. "". I encourage people to talk to their friends about their condition, and then they find often that (the friend) has, for example, an eczema that she's embarrassed about,"" says Mary- Joan Gerson, Ph D, a psychoanalyst and family therapist at the Mind Body Digestive Center in New York.. Meditation and other stress management techniques may also be valuable in dealing with uncomfortable situations. "". When you start to get that panic feeling, you can go into that other state of consciousness,"" says Gerson, noting that regular practice of things like meditation can help you even if you're in the middle of a meeting. "". If you do meditation as a practice, you can take a couple of deep breaths and get yourself into something like that different perspective."". If you still have trouble dealing with your condition, see a therapist, advises Gerson.. She and her husband, Charles Gerson, MD, a gastroenterologist, worked with 41 patients who received both psychotherapy and standard medical care.. In two weeks, the patients reported a 50% improvement in symptoms.. Psychotherapy is part of an approach called behavioral therapy.. Other types of this treatment include relaxation therapy, biofeedback, hypnotherapy, and cognitive behavioral therapy.. Indeed, there are many ways to cope with IBS.. Hiding is not a good option.. Roberts says people who avoid going out because of their fear get to a point where ''they feel they can't do anything,'' he says. "". You can cope,"" Roberts says. "". It's a matter of trying to live with your symptoms rather than having your symptoms take over your life.""","[['Learning about IBS', 'helps in', 'dealing with it'], ['Support networks', 'include', 'doctors, nurse practitioners, therapists, and dietitians'], ['IBS Patient Support Group', 'has_meetings_online_at', 'www.ibspatient.org']]"

A combination of stretching, aerobic, breathing, and strengthening exercises can be recommended, with focus on each type depending on individual COPD exercise programs suggested by healthcare providers. Exercises such as walking, using a stationary bike, and practicing pursed-lip and diaphragmatic breathing can be particularly helpful for individuals with COPD. It is crucial to consult with a doctor before starting a COPD exercise program and to gradually increase exercise duration and frequency while balancing with rest. Exercise precautions should also be taken, including avoiding heavy lifting, certain outdoor exercises, and high-impact activities, as well as following any medication restrictions and taking appropriate post-exercise","[['Exercise', 'benefits', 'individuals_with_COPD'], ['individuals_with_COPD', 'have_condition', 'chronic_obstructive_pulmonary_disease'], ['Exercise', 'improves', 'oxygen_usage_in_body'], ['improving_oxygen_usage_in_body', 'helps', 'individuals_with_COPD'], ['Exercise', 'decreases', 'symptoms'], ['Exercise', 'improves', 'breathing'], ['Exercise', 'strengthens', 'heart'], ['Exercise', 'strengthens', 'bones'], ['Exercise', 'enhances', 'mental_and_emotional_well_being'], ['Exercise', 'increases', 'energy_levels'], ['Exercise', 'recommended_types', ""['stretching', 'aerobic', 'breathing', 'strengthening']""], ['stretching_exercises', 'type_of', 'exercise'], ['aerobic_exercises', 'type_of', 'exercise'], ['breathing_exercises', 'type_of', 'exercise'], ['strengthening_exercises', 'type_of', 'exercise'], ['walking', 'example_of', 'aerobic_exercise'], ['stationary_bike', 'example_of', 'aerobic_exercise'], ['pursed_lip_breathing', 'example_of', 'breathing_exercise'], ['diaphragmatic_breathing', 'example_of', 'breathing_exercise'], ['consult_doctor_before_starting', 'precaution_for', 'COPD_exercise_program'], ['gradually_increase_exercise_duration_and_frequency', 'precaution_for', 'COPD_exercise_program'], ['balance_exercise_with_rest', 'precaution_for', 'COPD_exercise_program']]","Exercise -- especially exercise that works your lungs and heart -- has many benefits for those with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease ( COPD)..

How much you focus on each type depends on the COPD exercise program your health care provider suggests for you.. Stretching exercises lengthen your muscles, increasing your flexibility.. Aerobic exercises use large muscle groups to move at a steady, rhythmic pace.. This type of exercise works your heart and lungs, improving their endurance.. This helps your body use oxygen more efficiently and, with time, can improve your breathing.. Walking and using a stationary bike are two good aerobic exercises if you have COPD.. Strengthening exercises involve tightening muscles until they begin to tire.. When you do this for the upper body, it can help increase the strength of your breathing muscles.. Breathing exercises for COPD help you strengthen breathing muscles, get more oxygen, and breathe with less effort.. Here are two examples of breathing exercises you can begin practicing.. Work up to 5 to 10 minutes, three to four times a day.. Pursed-lip breathing: Relax your neck and shoulder muscles.. Breathe in for 2 seconds through your nose, keeping your mouth closed.. Breathe out for 4 seconds through pursed lips.. If this is too long for you, simply breathe out twice as long as you breathe in.. Use pursed-lip breathing while exercising.. If you experience shortness of breath, first try slowing your rate of breathing and focus on breathing out through pursed lips.. Diaphragmatic breathing: Lie on your back with knees bent.. You can put a pillow under your knees for support.. Place one hand on your belly below your rib cage.. Place the other hand on your chest.. Inhale deeply through your nose for a count of three.. Your belly and lower ribs should rise, but your chest should remain still.. Tighten your stomach muscles and exhale for a count of six through slightly puckered lips.. Set realistic goals.. Gradually increase the number of minutes and days you exercise.. A good goal is to exercise 20 to 40 minutes, 2 to 4 times a week.. Start out slow.. Warm up for a few minutes.. Choose activities you enjoy, and vary them to help you stay motivated.. Find an exercise partner.. Keep a record of your exercise to help you stay on track.. As you end your exercise, cool down by moving more slowly.. It's good to take precautions when exercising with COPD, but remember that shortness of breath doesn't always mean you should stop altogether.. Ask your doctor about when you should stop exercising and rest.. Here are other exercise precautions: Always consult a doctor or other health care provider before starting a COPD exercise program.. If you have a change in any medications, talk to your doctor before continuing your exercise routine.. Balance exercise with rest.. If you feel tired, start at a lower level.. If you feel very tired, rest, and try again the next day.. Wait at least an hour and a half after eating before beginning to exercise.. When you drink fluids while exercising, remember any fluid restrictions you have.. Avoid hot or cold showers after exercising.. If you've been away from exercise for several days, start up slowly, and gradually return to your regular routine.. Exercises to avoid when you have COPD: Heavy lifting or pushing Chores such as shoveling, mowing, or raking Pushups, sit-ups, or isometric exercises, which involve pushing against immovable objects Outdoor exercises when the weather is very cold, hot, or humid Walking up steep hills Ask your doctor whether exercises like weightlifting, jogging, and swimming are OK for you to do.. If you experience any of these signs or symptoms, stop your COPD exercise program right away.. Sit down, and keep your feet raised while resting.. If you don't feel better right away, call 911..

A doctor can help determine if you have a food allergy or intolerance, and provide guidance on how to manage symptoms and avoid trigger foods.","[['Food allergy', 'distinguished_from', 'food_intolerance'], ['food_intolerance', 'causes_symptoms', 'nausea'], ['food_intolerance', 'causes_symptoms', 'stomach_pain'], ['food_intolerance', 'causes_symptoms', 'diarrhea'], ['food_intolerance', 'causes_symptoms', 'vomiting'], ['Food allergy', 'distinguished_from', 'food_intolerance_2'], ['food_intolerance_2', 'causes_symptoms', 'gas'], ['food_intolerance_2', 'causes_symptoms', 'cramps'], ['food_intolerance_2', 'causes_symptoms', 'bloating'], ['food_intolerance_2', 'causes_symptoms', 'heartburn'], ['food_intolerance_2', 'causes_symptoms', 'headaches'], ['food_intolerance_2', 'causes_symptoms', 'irritability_or_nervousness'], ['Food allergy', 'can_also_cause', 'food_intolerance_symptoms']]","It's pretty common to have a reaction to a certain food, but in most cases it's an intolerance rather than a true allergy.. Why does it matter?. Although they may have similar symptoms, a food allergy can be more serious.. These clues can help you figure out if it is an allergy or intolerance.. A doctor can help you know for sure.. Food Allergy: Usually comes on suddenly Small amount of food can trigger Happens every time you eat the food Can be life-threatening Food Intolerance: Usually comes on gradually May only happen when you eat a lot of the food May only happen if you eat the food often Is not life-threatening A food allergy and an intolerance both can cause: Nausea Stomach pain Diarrhea Vomiting When a food irritates your stomach or your body can't properly digest it, that's an intolerance.. You may have these symptoms: Gas, cramps, or bloating Heartburn Headaches Irritability or nervousness A food allergy happens when your immune system mistakes something in food as harmful and attacks it.. It can affect your whole body, not just your stomach.. Symptoms may include: Rash, hives, or itchy skin Shortness of breath Chest pain Sudden drop in blood pressure, trouble swallowing or breathing -- this is life-threatening.. Call 911 immediately.. These triggers cause about 90% of food allergies: Peanuts Tree nuts (such as walnuts, pecans and almonds) Fish Shellfish Milk Eggs Soy Wheat The most common food intolerance is lactose intolerance.. It happens when people can't digest lactose, a sugar found in milk and dairy.. Another kind of intolerance is being sensitive to sulfites or other food additives.. Sulfites can trigger asthma attacks in some people.. What about a gluten allergy?. While celiac disease -- a long-lasting digestive condition that's triggered by eating gluten -- does involve the immune system, it doesn't cause life-threatening symptoms.. Your doctor can find out if you have an allergy or intolerance.. These things may help: Keep a diary of the foods you eat and the symptoms you have.. Stop eating some foods to help figure out which one is causing symptoms.. Have allergy tests done.. If you have a food allergy, you'll need to stop eating the food altogether.. If you have a food intolerance, you'll need to avoid or cut back on that food in your diet.. For lactose intolerance, you can look for lactose-free milk or take a lactase enzyme supplement.. With a food allergy, you could be at risk for anaphylaxis, a life-threatening reaction.. Ask your doctor if you need to carry epinephrine shots ( Adreniclick, Auvi- Q, Epi Pen, a generic, or Symjepi) which you could give yourself in an emergency.. If so, always carry two injections with you.. Learn which foods -- and how much -- cause you to have symptoms.. Either avoid the food or only have as much as you can without triggering symptoms.. When you eat out, ask your server about how your meal will be prepared.. It may not always be clear from the menu whether some dishes contain problem foods.. Learn to read food labels and check the ingredients for trigger foods.. Don't forget to check condiments and seasonings.. They may have MSG or another additive that can cause symptoms.","[['Food allergy', 'characterized_by', 'sudden_onset'], ['Food allergy', 'triggered_by', 'small_amount_of_food'], ['Food intolerance', 'characterized_by', 'gradual_onset'], ['Food intolerance', 'triggered_by', 'large_amount_of_food'], ['Food allergy', 'can_be_diagnosed_by', 'allergy_tests'], ['Food intolerance', 'can_be_diagnosed_by', 'allergy_tests'], ['Food allergy', 'common_triggers', 'peanuts'], ['Food allergy', 'common_triggers', 'tree_nuts'], ['Food allergy', 'common_triggers', 'fish'], ['Food allergy', 'common_triggers', 'shellfish'], ['Food allergy', 'common_triggers', 'milk'], ['Food allergy', 'common_triggers', 'eggs'], ['Food allergy', 'common_triggers', 'soy'], ['Food allergy', 'common_triggers', 'wheat'], ['Food intolerance', 'common_type', 'lactose_intolerance'], ['Food intolerance', 'common_type', 'sulfite_intolerance']]"
36,Why is malnutrition not likely with ulcerative colitis (UC)?,"Ulcerative colitis (UC) does not usually affect the small intestine, where vitamins, minerals, and proteins are absorbed.","[['Ulcerative colitis', 'does not usually affect', 'small intestine'], ['small intestine', 'responsible for', 'absorption of vitamins, minerals, and proteins'], ['Ulcerative colitis', 'typically does not cause', 'malnutrition']]","Ulcerative colitis (UC) typically doesn't affect the small intestine, where vitamins, minerals, and proteins are absorbed. While it can be challenging for individuals with UC to maintain a balanced diet due to food sensitivities and loss of appetite, malnutrition is not a common issue. It is essential to focus on consuming a diverse diet, including lean meats, fish, poultry, low-fat dairy products, bread, cereals, whole grains, fruits, vegetables, and healthy fats, whenever possible. Regularly monitoring food intake and maintaining open communication with healthcare professionals can help manage nutrient deficiencies and maintain overall health.","[['Ulcerative colitis', 'can make it challenging for individuals to', 'maintain a balanced diet']]","What you eat doesn't cause or cure ulcerative colitis.. But eating a diet that's good for you is always a wise idea.. It may even help you spend more time in remission and feel better.. Malnutrition isn't usually a problem.. Your small intestine is where you absorb vitamins, minerals, and proteins.. And UC usually doesn't affect that part of your body.. Still, it can be tricky to eat a well-balanced diet.. Many people with UC find certain foods don't agree with them.. And loss of appetite or fear of eating can cause you to lose weight or miss out on nutrients.. The best time to think about nutrition is when you're not having a flare.. Most experts say that people with UC should simply try to eat a well-balanced diet whenever possible.. This should include a variety of foods: Lean meat, fish, and poultry Low-fat dairy products Bread, cereal, and whole grains Fruits and vegetables Healthy fats such as vegetable oils Keep a food diary to help you figure out which foods cause problems for you and whether or not you're getting enough nutrients.. If you lose weight because of your ulcerative colitis, try to eat five or six small meals and snacks during the day instead of two or three large meals.. When you have chronic diarrhea, drink plenty of water or other fluids to stay hydrated.. A dietitian can make a plan diet that meets your calorie and nutrient needs.. Before you take any dietary supplements, talk to your doctor or dietitian.. You may not have to say goodbye to foods such as whole grains, fruits, and vegetables because you have UC.. Besides its nutritional benefits, fiber soaks up extra water in your system and can firm stools.. Even if a high-fiber food seems to worsen your UC symptoms during a flare-up, it may be OK when the flare is over.. The only way to know if a particular food is a problem for you is to remove it from your diet and then gradually start to eat it again.. Aim for 20 to 30 grams of fiber a day.. Steaming, baking, or stewing fruits and vegetables before eating them may be easier on your digestive tract than eating them raw.. If your doctor has recommended a low-fiber diet, you may miss out on the vitamins and minerals that are naturally in many high-fiber foods.. Ask your doctor or dietitian if you should take a supplement.. Fish oil -- found in salmon, mackerel, sardines, herring, and black cod, as well as supplements -- acts as an anti-inflammatory.. Though early studies are mixed, fish and flaxseed oils may help tame colon inflammation.. Probiotics are ""good"" bacteria that live in your intestines.. You can also find them in foods like yogurt and in supplements.. Some researchers, as well as people with inflammatory bowel disease, think probiotics help ease symptoms.. Researchers think adding more probiotics to your digestive tract might help treat the disease.. In European studies, the probiotic E. coli Nissle helped prevent UC flares, but it isn't available in the U. S. Other studies are testing different probiotics to help control UC.. If you and your doctor decide to try probiotics, you'll need to keep taking enough of the right kind for it to work.. People with UC often think they have lactose intolerance, which means they can't properly digest the sugar in milk and milk products, because some symptoms are similar.. But UC doesn't make you more likely to have lactose intolerance.. Your doctor can do a simple test to find out.. If you can, keep milk and dairy products in your diet.. They are a very good source of calcium and vitamin D, which keep your bones healthy.. Using steroids such as prednisone for a long time can thin your bones and make it harder for your body to absorb calcium, raising your chance of having osteoporosis.. If dairy products cause you discomfort, see if you can eat them in small amounts.. Or try a lactase supplement to break down the lactose in dairy products.. If you just can't stomach dairy products, your doctor may want you to take calcium and vitamin D supplements.. People with UC need to be especially careful to get enough folate, iron, and potassium.. Folate helps prevent cancer and birth defects.. Some 5- ASA medications such as sulfasalazine ( Azulfidine) can make it harder for your body to absorb folate.. Blood loss due to inflammation and ulcers in the colon can cause low iron levels.. A simple blood test can tell.. Diarrhea or taking steroids can cause low potassium and magnesium levels.. Talk to your doctor about whether these nutrients could be a problem for you.. You may need to take vitamins just in case.. Nutrition supplement drinks can also make up for missing nutrients, but they may cause diarrhea.",[]

It's often linked to a buildup of pressure inside your eye.. Glaucoma tends to be inherited and may not show up until later in life.. The increased pressure, called intraocular pressure, can damage the optic nerve, which transmits images to your brain.. If the damage continues, glaucoma can lead to permanent vision loss.. Without treatment, glaucoma can cause total permanent blindness within a few years.. Most people with glaucoma have no early symptoms or pain.. You need to see your eye doctor regularly so she can diagnose and treat glaucoma before long-term visual loss happens.. If you're over age 40 and have a family history of the disease, you should get a complete eye exam from an eye doctor every 1 to 2 years.. If you have health problems like diabetes or a family history of glaucoma or are at risk for other eye diseases, you may need to go more often.. It's the result of an intrinsic deterioration of the optic nerve, which leads to high fluid pressure on the front part of the eye.. Normally, the fluid, called aqueous humor, flows out of your eye through a mesh-like channel.. If this channel gets blocked, the liquid builds up.. The reason for the blockage is unknown, but doctors do know it can be inherited, meaning it's passed from parents to children.. Less common causes include a blunt or chemical injury to your eye, severe eye infection, blocked blood vessels inside the eye, and inflammatory conditions.. It's rare, but sometimes eye surgery to correct another condition can bring it on.. It usually affects both eyes, but it may be worse in one than the other.. There are two main kinds: Open-angle glaucoma.. It's the most common type.. Your doctor may also call it wide-angle glaucoma.. The drain structure in your eye -- it's called the trabecular meshwork -- looks normal, but fluid doesn't flow out like it should.. Angle-closure glaucoma.. It's less common in the West than in Asia.. You may also hear it called acute or chronic angle-closure or narrow-angle glaucoma.. Your eye doesn't drain right because the drain space between your iris and cornea becomes too narrow.. This can cause a sudden buildup of pressure in your eye.. It's also linked to farsightedness and cataracts, a clouding of the lens inside your eye.. It mostly affects adults over 40, but young adults, children, and even infants can have it.. African- Americans tend to get it more often, when they're younger, and with greater vision loss.. You're more likely to get it if you: Are of African- American, Irish, Russian, Japanese, Hispanic, Inuit, or Scandinavian descent Are over 40 Have a family history of glaucoma Have poor vision Have diabetes Take certain steroid medications, like prednisone Have had trauma to the eye or eyes Most people don't have any.. The first sign is often a loss of peripheral, or side, vision.. That can go unnoticed until late in the disease.. That's why glaucoma is often called the ""sneak thief of vision."". Detecting glaucoma early is one reason you should have a complete exam with an eye specialist every 1 to 2 years.. Occasionally, pressure inside the eye can rise to severe levels.. In these cases, you may have sudden eye pain, headache, blurred vision, or the appearance of halos around lights.. If you have any of the following symptoms, seek immediate medical care: Seeing halos around lights Vision loss Redness in the eye Eye that looks hazy (particularly in infants) Nausea or vomiting Eye pain Narrowed vision (tunnel vision) Your eye doctor will use drops to open (he'll call it dilate) your pupils.. Then he'll test your vision and examine your eyes.. He'll check your optic nerve, and if you have glaucoma, it will look a certain way.. He may take photographs of the nerve to help him track your disease over time.. He'll do a test called tonometry to check your eye pressure.. He'll also do a visual field test, if necessary, to figure out if you've lost your side, or peripheral, vision.. Glaucoma tests are painless and take very little time.. Your doctor may use prescription eye drops, laser surgery, or microsurgery to lower pressure in the eye.. Eye drops.. These either reduce the formation of fluid in the eye or increase its outflow, thereby lowering eye pressure.. Side effects may include allergies, redness, stinging, blurred vision, and irritated eyes.. Some glaucoma drugs may affect your heart and lungs.. Be sure to tell your doctor about any other medications you're taking or are allergic to.. Laser surgery.. This procedure can slightly increase the flow of the fluid from the eye for people with open-angle glaucoma.. It can stop fluid blockage if you have angle-closure glaucoma.. Procedures include: Trabeculoplasty: Opens the drainage area Iridotomy: Makes a tiny hole in the iris to let fluid flow more freely Cyclophotocoagulation: Treats areas of the middle layer of your eye to reduce fluid production Microsurgery.. In a procedure called a trabeculectomy, the doctor creates a new channel to drain the fluid and ease eye pressure.. Sometimes this form of glaucoma surgery fails and has to be redone.. Your doctor might implant a tube to help drain fluid.. Surgery can cause temporary or permanent vision loss, as well as bleeding or infection.. Open-angle glaucoma is most often treated with various combinations of eye drops, laser trabeculoplasty, and microsurgery.. Doctors in the U. S. tend to start with medications, but there's evidence that early laser surgery or microsurgery could work better for some people.. Infant or congenital glaucoma -- meaning you are born with it -- is primarily treated with surgery, because the cause of the problem is a very distorted drainage system.. Talk to your eye doctor to find out which glaucoma treatment is right for you.. No.. But if you diagnose and treat it early, you can control the disease.. At this time, lost vision can't be restored.. However, lowering eye pressure can help preserve the sight you have.. Most people with glaucoma who follow their treatment plan and have regular eye exams don't go blind.","[['Less_common_causes', 'includes', 'blunt_or_chemical_injury_to_eye'], ['Less_common_causes', 'includes', 'severe_eye_infection'], ['Less_common_causes', 'includes', 'blocked_blood_vessels_inside_eye'], ['Less_common_causes', 'includes', 'inflammatory_conditions'], ['Less_common_causes', 'includes', 'eye_surgery_to_correct_another_condition']]"

A positive result indicates the presence of ketones, and you should report it to your doctor immediately. Ketones are produced when the body doesn't have enough insulin and turns to fat stores to create energy for cells. In large amounts, they can cause a life-threatening emergency condition called ketoacidosis. People with type 1 diabetes are more likely to experience ketoacidosis and should regularly monitor their urine for ketones, especially during illnesses or when their blood sugar level is high. People with type 2 diabetes have a lower risk of ketones, but should still be aware of the symptoms and report a positive result to their doctor.","[['Doctors', 'recommend', 'over-the-counter kit'], ['over-the-counter kit', 'contains', 'test strip'], ['urine sample', 'dipped into', 'test strip'], ['color change', 'compared to', 'chart'], ['positive result', 'indicates', 'presence of ketones'], ['presence of ketones', 'can cause', 'ketoacidosis'], ['people with type 1 diabetes', 'more likely to experience', 'ketoacidosis'], ['people with type 1 diabetes', 'should regularly monitor', 'urine for ketones'], ['ketones', 'produced when', ""body doesn't have enough insulin""], ['insulin', 'helps body use', 'glucose'], ['large amounts of ketones', 'can cause', 'life-threatening emergency condition']]","When you have diabetes, you're no stranger to tests that keep track of your disease.. Most look at your blood, but there are others.. Two simple ones that check your urine can help you and your doctor watch for kidney disease and severe high blood sugar.. About one-third of people with diabetes have problems with their kidneys.. But early and tight control of your blood sugar and blood pressure, plus help from certain medications, can keep these organs working like they should To check for problems, your doctor can do a test that measures the amount of protein in your urine, called microalbuminuria.. It shows up when small amounts of albumin (the main protein in your blood) seep into your pee.. Without treatment to slow the leak, your kidneys could be damaged and eventually fail.. You should get this test every year starting as soon as you're diagnosed with type 2 diabetes.. That's because high blood sugar is usually present many years before you find out you have the disease.. If you have type 1 diabetes, you probably won't get the test until you've been diagnosed for 5 years.. If the test is positive, your kidneys are leaking protein into your urine.. This is a sign that your kidneys are not working as well as they should -- even if you feel fine and have no symptoms.. Your doctor will suggest medications or lifestyle changes to help control these conditions: Kidney damage.. You may start specific medicines to prevent further harm.. If your microalbumin level is high, your doctor may suggest another type of test that requires you to collect samples for 24 hours.. This can better tell the extent of damage to the kidneys and see how well they're working.. High blood sugar.. Studies show tight control of your blood sugar can lower kidney damage, so your doctor may put you on more aggressive treatments.. Blood pressure.. Lowering blood pressure reduces your risk of diabetes-related kidney damage.. Get it checked each time you have an office visit.. The recommended reading for most people with diabetes is less than 130/80.. Cholesterol.. Since increases in microalbuminuria over time has been linked to heart disease risk, your doctor will work with you to keep your cholesterol and other fats in a healthy range.. Other factors that can increase the risk of kidney disease are being overweight or obese and smoking.. If you have type 1 diabetes, your doctor could ask you to check the urine for ketones.. Your body makes them when it doesn't have enough insulin and turns to fat stores to create energy for your cells.. Ketones are toxic in large amounts.. Too many of them can cause a life-threatening emergency condition called ketoacidosis.. Your doctor can check for ketone levels, or you can do it at home with an over-the-counter kit.. You simply dip a test strip into your urine.. It will change color, and you'll compare it to a chart to see what your reading means..

Your blood sugar level is over 300 mg/d L. You have symptoms of high blood sugar including extreme thirst or tiredness, a flushed or foggy feeling, or your breath smells fruity.. The doctor tells you to.. If you have type 2 diabetes, there isn't much chance you'll have too many ketones, even if you're taking insulin.. But it could happen during a severe illness.. Your doctor may tell you to check your urine when: You have a cold, the flu, or other illness or have unexplained nausea or vomiting.. Your blood sugar level is over 300 mg/d L and continues to rise throughout the day.. A urine test for ketones should always be negative.. Report a positive result to your doctor immediately.. You should also let her know right away if your blood sugar remains high or if you have stomach pain, nausea, vomiting, rapid breathing, sweet-smelling breath, or if you're peeing a lot.. The doctor may tell you to: Drink plenty of water and fluids to lower the amounts of ketones and stay hydrated.. Continue to check your blood sugar.. If it's high, you may need to give yourself a small amount of rapid-acting insulin.. Go to the local emergency room so you can get intravenous fluids and insulin..

If you're over 40 and have never had a migraine, assume your pain is something more serious.. People who get migraine typically have it most of their lives.. It's rare to have your first symptoms when you're older.. If you get migraine and your aura symptoms or headaches seem different than what you've typically experienced,, get checked out.. Most people with migraine have similar symptoms each time.. During a stroke, blood flow to part of your brain is cut off.. Cells there don't get enough oxygen and start to die.. There can be two causes.. Either a blood vessel is blocked, for instance with a blood clot, or a blood vessel tears or bursts and causes bleeding in or around the brain.. A sudden severe headache can be a sign of a stroke.. Other common symptoms are: Numbness or weakness, especially on one side of your body Trouble speaking or trouble understanding others Vision problems in one or both eyes Sudden dizziness or loss of balance or coordination Confusion The kind of stroke that tends to be mistaken for a migraine is called a transient ischemic attack, or TIA.. It's also known as a ""mini stroke"" because blood flow to your brain is cut off only for a short time.. Symptoms are less severe than with a regular stroke and may last less than an hour.. Migraine is a disease that causes recurrent attacks of head pain together with other symptoms such as a bad headache that often comes with nausea, vomiting, and sensitivity to light, sound, smell, or touch.. The pain may throb or pulse, and you usually feel it on one side of your head around your eye or temple.. A migraine with aura is the kind that can be confused with a stroke.. An aura affects your senses and usually happens before the headache.. You may see light flashes, zig-zagged lines, or blind spots, or you might feel tingling or numbness in your arms, legs, or face.. You might have ringing in your ears or trouble speaking.. Sometimes, you'll have those symptoms but never get a headache.. That tends to happen more often as you get older.. It can be hard to tell the difference between a migraine with aura and a TIA.. Here's what to look for: With a stroke, symptoms usually come on suddenly.. With a migraine, they happen gradually; the headache usually starts small and gets more painful.. A stroke is more likely to have what are called ""negative"" symptoms such as you might lose sight in one eye or lose feeling in one of your hands or feet.. A migraine is more likely to have ""positive"" symptoms.. That means added sensations, like flashes in your vision or tingling in your skin.. If you're young, it's more likely to be a migraine.. If you're older, it's more likely to be a stroke, especially if you've never had a migraine before or you have high blood pressure or an irregular heartbeat.. Doctors aren't sure exactly how migraine and strokes are linked.. They do know that people who get migraine with aura are about twice as likely to have a stroke as people who don't get migraine at all.. The risk goes way up if you're also a young woman who smokes and takes birth control pills.. A migraine without aura don't seem to affect your chances of having a stroke..

Some research has found that a migraine can cause inflammation inside your arteries.. That can make them stiff and cause your blood to clot more easily.. Both of those increase your chances of a stroke.. It's possible to have a stroke while you're having a migraine, but that doesn't mean the migraine caused the stroke..

All young kids have some difficulty when it comes to writing or perfecting penmanship.. But if your child's handwriting is consistently distorted or unclear, that may be caused by a learning disability called dysgraphia.. This is a nervous system problem that affects the fine motor skills needed to write.. It makes it hard for a child to do handwriting tasks and assignments.. Health insurers and most doctors call this condition ""an impairment in written expression."". Scientists aren't sure why dysgraphia happens in children.. In adults, it's sometimes related to a brain injury.. In kids, this learning disorder usually occurs along with other learning disabilities such as ADHD and dyslexia..

Creative writing tasks are often especially hard.. The first step is for your child's pediatrician to rule out any other diseases or conditions that could cause writing difficulties.. A licensed psychologist trained in learning disorders can diagnose dysgraphia.. This could be your child's school psychologist.. The specialist will give your child academic and writing tests that measure his ability to put thoughts into words and his fine motor skills.. For instance, he may be asked to tap his fingers or turn his wrist a certain way.. Your child also may be asked to write sentences or copy words and letters..

Try pencil grips or other writing aids for comfort.. Let her use a computer to type instead of write, and teach typing skills early.. Don't criticize sloppy work.. Praise her hard work and offer positive reinforcement.. Acknowledge the condition and talk to your child about it.. Teach her ways to relieve stress before writing.. For example, have her shake or rub her hands together quickly.. Let her squeeze a stress ball to improve hand-muscle strength and coordination.. Talk to your child's teacher about her condition and needs at school.. She may qualify for special education services and an Individualized Education Program ( IEP) or other special assistance (such as a 504 plan).. These documents detail your child's needs and give the school ways to help her.. Some things you might ask for include: Shorter writing assignments or different questions from her classmates Use of a computer to type instead of write Copies of the class notes to limit writing work Use of a voice-to-dictation machine or another electronic note taker An option to record the teacher's lectures Video or audio reports instead of written homework assignments Oral instead of written exams","[['handwriting_clarity', 'includes', 'unclear_handwriting'], ['handwriting_clarity', 'includes', 'irregular_handwriting'], ['handwriting_clarity', 'includes', 'inconsistent_handwriting'], ['handwriting_clarity', 'includes', 'different_slants'], ['handwriting_clarity', 'includes', 'different_shapes'], ['handwriting_clarity', 'includes', 'different_cursive_and_print_styles']]"

It can help manage hyperactivity and increase focus and attention. Additionally, engaging in physical activities can serve as a healthy distraction from potential impulses to overeat. Incorporating regular exercise into daily routines, such as taking breaks to do short workouts or participating in group activities, can be effective ways to improve overall well-being and potentially reduce weight gain associated with ADHD or its treatments.","[['ADHD', 'can_lead_to', 'weight_gain']]","If you have attention deficit hyperactivity disorder ( ADHD), you may take medicine to help with things like focus, attention, and hyperactivity.. But that medication also can have side effects, including weight changes.. Merely having ADHD may lead to weight gain as well.. Not being able to control your impulses can lead to junk food cravings and overeating.. That can make it easy to put weight on and hard to take it back off.. But if your ADHD or the drugs you take to treat it lead to a few extra pounds, you're not stuck with the extra weight.. You can do some things to limit -- and reverse -- that kind of weight gain.. Sometimes the medicines most often used to treat ADHD can cause weight loss.. Stimulant drugs like methylphenidate ( Ritalin) and amphetamine/dextroamphetamine ( Adderall) make you less hungry and make your body burn calories faster than usual.. Some of them are even used to help people lose weight or treat binge eating.. .. Although the stimulant effect of ADHD medications can curb your appetite and help burn calories, once it wears off, your appetite can come roaring back.. And if you overeat when you're not on your medicine, you could gain weight, especially since that's most often in the evening or at night.. Some people with ADHD also have depression and take antidepressants.. A few of those have been linked to weight gain.. People who have ADHD are about 5 times more likely to be overweight or obese than those who don't have it.. There are a few possible reasons: Hard time controlling impulses: This can make it tough to resist another piece of pizza or a second slice of cake.. People with ADHD are 5 times more likely to have the eating disorder bulimia, which can involve bingeing or overeating.. The dopamine connection: This brain chemical might be at least partly to blame for overeating in connection with ADHD.. Dopamine is part of your brain's reward center.. It's the ""feel-good"" chemical that makes you satisfied after you eat a jelly doughnut or an order of French fries.. People with ADHD tend to have low levels of dopamine.. In fact, the stimulant drugs used to treat ADHD boost those levels.. Eating high-carb foods also triggers a dopamine rush.. That's why you might crave cookies, cakes, and other junk foods.. Eating habits: Many ADHD symptoms can keep you from eating healthy.. If you can't plan ahead well, it can be hard to have time for low-calorie, nutritious meals or exercise.. Trouble focusing and poor impulse control can distract you from choosing the right foods at a restaurant or supermarket, or from cooking a healthy meal at home.. Lack of attention can keep you from realizing you're full.. Trouble managing stress can lead to emotional eating.. If you don't like being bored, you might be more likely to eat when you have nothing else to do.. If you have trouble controlling your urges to eat, one idea is to make it harder to binge.. Keep chips, candy, and other junk foods out of your house.. Stock your fridge and pantry with good-for-you treats like these in case you have a craving: Fresh fruit Carrot and celery sticks Nuts Cheese sticks Low-fat yogurt Make a list before you go to the supermarket, and stick with it so you won't be tempted to buy something unhealthy.. To make meals easier, cook a big batch of dinners at once and freeze them.. Or use a prepared healthy meal service that delivers to your door.. If hyperactivity is a problem for you, use the extra energy to exercise.. Go for a walk, do yoga, or just dance around your room.. If you get bored easily, don't try to do a full hour of exercise at once.. Break your routine into 10- or 15-minute segments to make them easier to finish.. To help you stay motivated, keep track of your diet and fitness in a diary.. A few smartphone apps make it easy to track your progress.. Some apps even turn diet and exercise into a game or competition with friends and family to make it more fun.",[]

They can help your kid: See better: Rigid gas permeable lenses may offer better vision than her glasses.. And contacts let you see what's to the side of you (the eye doctor will call this peripheral vision).. Feel better: Glasses go in and out of style, but some kids just don't want to wear them school..

What experts do know is that when you have type 1 diabetes, something goes wrong with your immune system -- the body's defense against germs.. It destroys beta cells in your pancreas that are responsible for making a hormone called insulin.. Insulin allows glucose -- or sugar -- to get into your cells, where it's turned into energy..

People of all races and ethnic groups can get type 1 diabetes, but it's most common among those of northern European descent.. You may also be at higher risk for getting the disease if one of your parents or a brother or sister has it.. It's not always easy to tell if you have type 1 diabetes when you're an adult.. There are a number of reasons for this.. For one thing, symptoms take longer to show up in grownups than they do in kids.. This can make it harder for doctors to know what's going on, especially if they don't specialize in the condition.. Another confusing part of getting a diagnosis is that many people with type 1 diabetes are lean or have a normal weight.. Your doctor might rule out diabetes, since most people with type 2 diabetes are overweight.. Your doctor may suggest several tests that can tell you if you have diabetes, although you won't know if it's type 1 or type 2.. Glycated hemoglobin ( A1c) test.. It measures your average blood glucose level for 2 to 3 months.. If you have an A1c level of 6.5 or higher on two separate exams, you have diabetes.. Random blood sugar test.. It checks your blood glucose at a random time of day.. A level of 200 mg/d L or higher is a sign that you have diabetes.. Fasting blood sugar test.. Your doctor does this first thing in the morning, before you've eaten.. You have diabetes if your level is 126 mg/d L or higher on two separate tests.. Besides those exams, your doctor may also test your blood for certain antibodies that are common in type 1 diabetes.. And he might check your pee for ketones, or fat by-products.. If these are in your sample, you probably have type 1 diabetes.. Because your body no longer makes insulin, your treatment plan will include giving yourself insulin shots every day.. You'll also need to monitor your blood glucose levels.. Your doctor will probably encourage you to get regular exercise.. It can help you stay at a healthy weight and keep your blood glucose levels within a normal range.. He'll also work with you to come up with healthy, nutritious menu options that will help you keep your blood glucose under control.",[]

But head injury is not necessarily brain injury.. There are two types of brain injury: traumatic brain injury and acquired brain injury.. Both disrupt the brain's normal functioning.. Traumatic Brain Injury ( TBI) is caused by an external force -- such as a blow to the head -- that causes the brain to move inside the skull or damages the skull.. This in turn damages the brain.. Acquired Brain Injury ( ABI) occurs at the cellular level.. It is most often associated with pressure on the brain.. This could come from a tumor..

Some brain injuries cause focal -- or localized -- brain damage, such as the damage caused when a bullet enters the brain.. In other words, the damage is confined to a small area.. Closed head injuries frequently cause diffuse brain damage, which means damage to several areas of the brain..

When the brain is starved of oxygen for a prolonged period of time, brain damage may occur.. Brain damage can occur as a result of a wide range of injuries, illnesses, or conditions.. Because of high-risk behaviors, males between ages 15 and 24 are most vulnerable.. Young children and the elderly also have a higher risk.. Causes of traumatic brain injury include: Car accidents Blows to the head Sports injuries Falls or accidents Physical violence Causes of acquired brain injury include: Poisoning or exposure to toxic substances Infection Strangulation, choking, or drowning Stroke Heart attacks Tumors Aneurysms Neurological illnesses Abuse of illegal drugs There are numerous symptoms of brain damage, whether traumatic or acquired.. They fall into four major categories: Cognitive Perceptual Physical Behavioral/emotional Cognitive symptoms of brain damage include: Difficulty processing information Difficulty in expressing thoughts Difficulty understanding others Shortened attention span Inability to understand abstract concepts Impaired decision-making ability Memory loss Perceptual symptoms of brain damage include: Change in vision, hearing, or sense of touch Spatial disorientation Inability to sense time Disorders of smell and taste Balance issues Heightened sensitivity to pain Physical symptoms of brain damage include: Persistent headaches Extreme mental fatigue Extreme physical fatigue Paralysis Tremors Seizures Sensitivity to light Sleep disorders Slurred speech Loss of consciousness Behavioral/emotional symptoms of brain damage include: Irritability and impatience Reduced tolerance for stress Sluggishness Flattened or heightened emotions or reactions Denial of disability Increased aggressiveness Anyone who has a head or brain injury needs immediate medical attention.. A brain injury that seems mild -- referred to as a concussion -- can be as dangerous as clearly severe injuries.. The key factor is the extent and location of the damage.. Brain injury does not necessarily result in long-term disability or impairment.. But the correct diagnosis and treatment is needed to contain or minimize the damage.. The extent and effect of brain damage is determined by a neurological exam, neuroimaging testing such as MRI or CT scans, and neuropsychological assessments.. Doctors will stabilize the patient to prevent further injury, ensure blood and oxygen are flowing properly to the brain, and ensure that blood pressure is controlled.. Almost all patients will benefit from rehabilitation to assist in long-term recovery.. That may include: Physical therapy Occupational therapy Speech and language therapy Psychological support Most injuries that cause brain damage are preventable.. Here are some rules to follow to reduce the risk of brain damage: Never shake a child.. Install window guards to keep young children from falling out of open windows.. Install shock-absorbing material on playgrounds.. Wear helmets during sports or cycling.. Wear seatbelts in cars, and drive carefully.. Avoid falls by using a stepstool when reaching for high items.. Install handrails on stairways.. Don't keep guns; if you do, keep them unloaded and locked away.. Don't use illegal drugs.. Drink alcohol only in moderation, and never drink and drive.","[['Brain damage', 'is_caused_by', 'Trauma'], ['Brain damage', 'is_caused_by', 'Stroke'], ['Brain damage', 'is_caused_by', 'Tumor'], ['Brain damage', 'is_caused_by', 'Other_illnesses'], ['Trauma', 'includes', 'Car_accidents'], ['Trauma', 'includes', 'Sports_injuries'], ['Trauma', 'includes', 'Falls_or_accidents'], ['Trauma', 'includes', 'Physical_violence'], ['Stroke', 'is_a_type_of', 'Neurological_illness'], ['Stroke', 'can_be_caused_by', 'Poisoning_or_exposure_to_toxic_substances'], ['Stroke', 'can_be_caused_by', 'Infection'], ['Stroke', 'can_be_caused_by', 'Strangulation_choking_or_drowning'], ['Tumor', 'can_be_a_type_of', 'Neurological_illness'], ['Tumor', 'can_be_caused_by', 'Poisoning_or_exposure_to_toxic_substances'], ['Tumor', 'can_be_caused_by', 'Infection'], ['Tumor', 'can_be_caused_by', 'Neurological_illnesses'], ['Neurological_illnesses', 'include', 'Abuse_of_illegal_drugs']]"

Dopamine has an important job to do.. It acts like a messenger that tells another area of your brain when you want to move a part of your body.. When the cells that make dopamine start to die, your dopamine level drops.. When it gets too low, you can't control your movements as well and you start to get Parkinson's symptoms.. No one knows what triggers the death of those cells.. Scientists think it's your genes and environment working off of each other in a way we don't understand.. Your genes are like your body's instruction book.. So if you get a change in one of them, it can make your body work in a slightly different way.. Sometimes, that means you're more likely to get a certain disease.. There are several changes to genes that can raise your risk for Parkinson's, each by a little bit.. They have a part in about 1 in 10 cases.. If you have one or more of these changes, it doesn't mean you'll get Parkinson's.. Some people will, but many won't, and doctors don't know why.. It may have to do with other genes or something in your environment.. They can, but it's rare and only affects a small number of families.. About 1 in 100 people with Parkinson's get it this way.. Your environment is a hard one to pin down.. Partly, that's because it covers a lot of ground.. It's everything that's not your genes, which could mean where you live, what you eat, chemicals you've come into contact with, and more.. Not only that, but it could take years for the effects from something in your environment to show up.. So far, doctors have a lot of clues but no smoking gun.. So you could have people who live or work in an area around chemicals tied to Parkinson's, but many of them don't get it.. Some research shows links between Parkinson's and: Agent Orange, a chemical used to destroy trees and crops in the Vietnam War.. Certain chemicals used in farming, such as insecticides, herbicides, and fungicides.. Some metals and chemicals used in factories, such as manganese, lead, and trichlorethylene ( TCE).. These can come into play based on where you live, what you do for work, or if you served in the military.. Sometimes, these chemicals seep into well water, so that's one more way they can affect you.. It's a complex picture, but you may be more likely to get Parkinson's based on: Age.. Since it mostly affects people 60 and older, your risk goes up as the years go by.. Family history.. If your parent, brother, or sister has it, you're a little more likely to get it.. Job.. Some types of work, like farming or factory jobs, can cause you to have contact with chemicals linked to Parkinson's.. Race.. It shows up more often in white people than other groups.. Serious head injury.. If you hit your head hard enough to lose consciousness or forget things as a result of it, you may be more likely to get Parkinson's later in life.. Gender.. Men get it more than women.. Doctors aren't sure why.. Where you live.. People in rural areas seem to get it more often, which may be tied to chemicals used in farming.. As scientists try to learn what's at the root of Parkinson's, they're looking far and wide to pick up clues where they can.. They've found that people with Parkinson's tend to have something called Lewy bodies in their brain.. These are unusual clumps of a protein called alpha-synuclein.. The protein itself is normal, but the clumps are not.. And they're found in parts of the brain that affect sleep and sense of smell, which could explain some symptoms of Parkinson's not related to movement.. Your gut may also have a part in it, as some of its cells make dopamine, too.. Some doctors think that this might be where the earliest signs of Parkinson's show up, but that idea needs more research.","[['Agent Orange', 'used_in', 'Vietnam_War'], ['farming', 'uses', ""chemicals_linked_to_Parkinson's_disease""], ['factories', 'use', ""chemicals_linked_to_Parkinson's_disease""], ['substantia_nigra', 'contains', 'dopamine_producing_neurons'], ['dopamine', 'controls', 'movement'], ['substantia_nigra', 'affected_by', ""Parkinson's_disease""], [""Parkinson's_disease"", 'characterized_by', 'Lewy_bodies'], ['Lewy_bodies', 'contain', 'alpha-synuclein_protein'], ['Lewy_bodies', 'affect_brain_regions', 'affecting_sleep_and_smell'], ['gut', 'produces', 'dopamine']]"
47,Can you have elderly-onset rheumatoid arthritis and osteoarthritis?,"Elderly-onset rheumatoid arthritis and osteoarthritis can be a challenge to treat.

Elderly-onset RA and OA have some differences, but they also share symptoms like joint pain and stiffness. Your doctor may need to figure out which condition is the primary cause of your symptoms and how to best treat them. In some cases, you may need to manage both conditions with medications, gentle exercise, and lifestyle changes. Exercise, such as physical therapy, aquatherapy, and balance exercises, can help improve joint function and reduce pain for both conditions. It's important to discuss your symptoms and concerns with your healthcare provider to create a personalized treatment plan.","[['Elderly-onset rheumatoid arthritis', 'can coexist with', 'osteoarthritis'], ['Elderly-onset rheumatoid arthritis', 'symptoms', 'joint pain, stiffness'], ['Elderly-onset rheumatoid arthritis', 'challenges in diagnosis', 'similarities with other diseases'], ['Elderly-onset rheumatoid arthritis', 'treatment', 'medications, gentle exercise, lifestyle changes'], ['Exercise', 'benefits elderly-onset RA', 'improve joint function, reduce pain']]","You can get rheumatoid arthritis ( RA) at any age, but it's most likely to show up between ages 30 and 50.. When it starts between ages 60 and 65, it's called elderly-onset RA or late-onset RA.. Elderly-onset RA is different from RA that starts in earlier years.. It also comes with a separate set of treatment challenges.. Even though RA gets more common as you get older, people who get RA later in life only make up about one-third of all people with the disease.. There are some key differences between elderly-onset RA and early-onset RA, which happens in young and middle-age adults.. Women and men get elderly-onset RA at nearly the same rate.. Among younger people, women are more likely to have RA.. Symptoms come on quickly in elderly-onset RA.. You may hear this called acute onset.. If you get RA when you're younger, symptoms tend to show up over time.. Elderly-onset RA usually strikes large joints, like shoulders.. With younger people, the disease mostly starts in small joints, like your fingers and toes.. Rheumatoid factor ( RF) is less common in elderly-onset RA.. Rheumatoid factor is a protein.. If your blood tests show you have it, those proteins may attack healthy tissues.. Around 80% of people with early-onset RA have RF.. Overall, elderly-onset RA takes less of a toll.. It tends to be less severe.. The exception is if you have RF.. Your RA will probably be more aggressive RA than someone who doesn't have RF.. You'll notice more than just joint pain.. Look out for: Fever Muscle pain (myalgia) Weight loss Anemia Your tab tests may show: Elevated CRP ( C-reactive protein) Elevated ESR (erythrocyte sedimentation rate) It can be hard to spot this condition.. Your doctor has to figure out if it's really late-onset or if you've had the disease for years.. Elderly-onset RA also has symptoms that overlap with other diseases, like: Polymyalgia rheumatica ( PMR) Late-onset psoriatic arthritis Crystal arthritis Viral arthritis Osteoarthritis Rotator cuff tendinitis Hypothyroidism Parkinson's disease It may be hardest to tell elderly-onset RA from PMR, which has similar aches and test results (like elevated CRP and ESR levels).. Your treatment goal is remission, the lowest possible level of disease activity.. This can prevent joint damage and can keep your joints working like they should.. Your doctor will probably give you the same drugs used to treat early-onset RA.. These include: Disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs ( DMARDs) Biologic drugs Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs ( NSAIDs) Corticosteroids You might have more challenges with your medication, especially if you take drugs for other health conditions.. This boosts your chances of a bad reaction to the medicine.. You may also have a harder time with drug side effects.. NSAIDs increase your chances of heart, brain, gut, and kidney problems.. Corticosteroids up the odds of glaucoma, osteoporosis, and other health problems.. Elderly-onset RA may not be the only cause of your joint pain.. You could also have osteoarthritis.. Even if you take RA drugs, they may not do enough to reduce your pain and keep your joints working.. Gentle exercise can help, even if you've never done it before or can't get around much..

They're typically used when the skin condition covers more than 5% to 10% of your body and other treatments haven't worked.. While systemic treatment can help, many can cause serious side effects.. Your doctor will want to keep a close eye on you while you take the medicine.. Retinoids.. These are made from vitamin A and affect the way your skin cells grow and are shed.. Most doctors prescribe one called acitretin ( Soriatane).. If you have plaque psoriasis -- inflamed, red skin with silvery scales -- a retinoid works best when used with phototherapy.. On its own, it works well to treat pustular psoriasis -- a breakout of sore, red blisters or pus bumps -- and erythrodermic psoriasis in which most of your skin looks very red and peels as if it's burned.. This medication can cause serious birth defects even after you stop taking it.. Don't take it if you're pregnant or plan to get pregnant within 3 years.. Methotrexate.. This drug eases symptoms by curbing your immune system and slowing the growth of skin cells.. You take it once a week either by mouth or in a shot, and you should notice changes after 4 to 6 weeks.. But this drug can have serious side effects.. At first, you might have nausea or fatigue, and over time, it can damage your liver and blood cells.. Tell your doctor about any other health issues you have.. Methotrexate isn't safe for people who have anemia or liver disease.. You should also watch how much alcohol you drink.. Even one glass a day while you're on it can cause liver problems.. You'll need regular blood tests so your doctor can check on your blood cells and liver.. You'll need to take it with daily folic acid to reduce side effects.. Both men and women should stop taking it if they plan to start a family.. Cyclosporine.. This drug lowers your immune system.. It also slows skin cell growth.. It's used only for severe cases of psoriasis when nothing else seems to work.. You take it by mouth.. While it can help clear psoriasis, cyclosporine's benefits typically end when you stop taking it.. It also can lead to kidney problems, high blood pressure, and high cholesterol.. You shouldn't take it if you have a weak immune system or if you're breastfeeding.. You should also avoid it if you're treating your psoriasis with a form of phototherapy called PUVA.. Because of the side effects, experts don't recommend taking the drug for more than a year at a time.. Apremilast ( Otezla).. This is a newer drug used just for diseases that cause long-term inflammation, like psoriasis and psoriatic arthritis.. It shuts down an enzyme in your immune system, and that slows other reactions that lead to inflammation.. It comes in pill form.. Biologics..

That's because the condition makes you more likely to have foot problems such as numbness, sores, and poor blood flow.. If these issues get bad enough, they can mean you'll need surgery to remove your foot, called amputation.. You can avoid this operation, though, through two important strategies: Keep your condition under control, and be sure you protect and inspect your feet every day.. Many people with diabetes have two other conditions that raise their chances of foot amputation: diabetic neuropathy and peripheral arterial disease ( PAD).. Neuropathy is nerve damage.. It can mean you're less able to feel heat, cold, and even sharp objects.. If you have neuropathy in your feet, you could walk around all day with a rock in your shoe and not know it.. That means you could get a bad cut and not notice until it gets infected.. With PAD, fatty deposits build up in your arteries, causing poor blood flow to your legs and feet.. When you don't have good circulation, it's hard for your body to fight infections.. So, a cut you get from a rock in your shoe could get infected and not heal.. It's one reason a doctor may recommend amputation.. Poor blood flow also can cause gangrene, a medical term for dead tissue and a common reason for amputation.. Gangrene can happen because of PAD or when high blood sugar levels damage blood vessels over time.. Besides neuropathy and PAD, other things can raise your odds of a foot amputation: A family history of diabetes-related foot amputations Other family members with diabetes Foot ulcers Foot fractures Slow-healing wounds Toenail fungus or other toenail infections Bunions Corns Thick calluses Even with a bad infection or a wound that won't heal, your doctor may not suggest foot amputation -- at least not right away.. Depending on your condition, she might instead recommend: Surgery to clean the wound and remove dead tissue Antibiotics, which you'll get at the hospital through a tube (an IV) into your vein Amputation of one or more toes Surgery that brings new blood flow to your foot, called revascularization You're much more likely to avoid a foot amputation if you make your health and your feet a priority.. Some steps you can take to lower your risk: Quit smoking .. Like PAD and diabetes, smoking can reduce blood flow to your feet.. That can make wounds slow to heal.. Get some exercise.. It can help you control your diabetes and improve blood flow to your feet.. Check your feet every day.. Look over every part, even between your toes.. If you need help, ask a partner or use a mirror.. Let your doctor know if you see cuts, blisters, or any other foot problems, such as: Color changes, a sign of a problem with your foot's blood supply Less feeling in your feet Ingrown toenails Corns or calluses Plantar warts (flesh-colored growths) Warm spots Wear the right shoes.. They have to protect all parts of your feet, which rules out sandals, clogs, and other footwear that doesn't completely cover them.. Ask your doctor about prescription shoes -- your insurance plan may cover the cost.. Has your doctor already told you that amputation is the best thing to do?. Don't think of it as a failure of your diabetes treatment.. Think of it as a way to help you heal faster, so you can get back to the activities you enjoy.. Also, keep in mind that you may be getting rid of a serious infection that could have led to the amputation of your entire leg later..

By accidentally swallowing or breathing in their eggs.. You could eat or drink something that's contaminated with them and not know it.. The eggs can also live on surfaces like clothing, bedding, or other objects.. If you touch one of these items and then put your fingers in your mouth, you'll ingest the eggs..

People who live in crowded spaces, like institutions, have a higher risk of getting pinworm infections.. Most people who are infected don't have any.. If you do, they might include any of the following: Anal itching, especially at night Restless sleep Itching of the vaginal area -- if adult worms move to the vagina Feeling irritable Abdominal pain that comes and goes Talk to your doctor if you have severe anal itching -- especially at night.. Most of the time, pinworm infections don't cause serious problems.. In rare cases, and especially if you have a lot of them, the pinworms can travel from the anal area up the vagina to the uterus, fallopian tubes, and around the pelvic organs.. This can cause inflammation of the vagina -- what doctors call vulvovaginitis.. If you, your child, or someone in your household has symptoms of pinworm infection, call your doctor and ask about the tape test.. Simply take a clear piece of tape and press the sticky side to the skin around the anus.. Do this as soon as you or your child wake up -- before you use the bathroom, shower, or get dressed.. The pinworm eggs will stick to the tape.. You'll need to repeat this test three days in a row, then take all the pieces of tape to your doctor.. He'll view them under a microscope.. You'll need to take medications that kill the worms.. Your doctor may recommend an over-the-counter treatment like pyrantel pamoate ( Reese's Pinworm Medication, Pin- X).. He might also prescribe medication to everyone in your household to prevent infection and re-infection.. The most common prescription medicine for pinworms is albendazole ( Albenza).. You might have mild stomach upset while you're taking it.. And, you may need to take at least two doses to get rid of the worms completely.. For best results, the infected person and everyone in your house (including caretakers) should be treated at the same time.. Pinworm eggs can live on hard surfaces and in clothes and bedding for two to three weeks.. In addition to your regular household cleaning, you'll want to do the following things to stop the spread of these pests: Pinworms lay their eggs at night.. Wash your anal area in the morning to reduce the number of eggs on your body.. Shower to prevent possible re-contamination in bath water.. Don't bathe with anyone or share towels during treatment and for two weeks after final treatment.. Change your underwear and bed linens each day.. This helps remove eggs.. Wash bedsheets, nightclothes, underwear, washcloths, and towels in hot water to kill pinworm eggs.. Dry them on high heat.. Don't scratch your anal area.. Trim your child's nails so there's less space for eggs to collect.. Discourage nail biting.. Wash your hands with soap and water after using the bathroom, changing diapers, and before handling food.. Teach your kids to do the same.","[['Pinworms', 'cause', 'anal_itching'], ['Pinworms', 'cause', 'restless_sleep'], ['Pinworms', 'cause', 'itching_of_the_vaginal_area'], ['Pinworms', 'cause', 'feeling_irritable'], ['Pinworms', 'cause', 'abdominal_pain_that_comes_and_goes'], ['Pinworms', 'transmitted_through', 'contaminated_food_or_water'], ['Pinworms', 'transmitted_through', 'contaminated_surfaces']]"

Symptoms can include burning, dull, achy pain, hard to breathe, pain on one side of the body, pressure, sharp pain, tickling, tightness, tingling, or pins and needles, vibration, and last from a few seconds to a few hours or even days. The hug can be caused by spasms in intercostal muscles between the ribs, which help expand the ribcage when moving, bending, or breathing. The doctor may call it dysesthesia, a sensation that isn't normal.

It can be: Burning Dull and achy pain Hard to breathe Pain on one side of your body Pressure Sharp pain Tickling Tightness Tingling or pins and needles Vibration It can last a few seconds to a few hours, and in rare cases, a few days.. People often say it's like wearing a girdle around the middle of your body.. For that reason, you may also hear it called by a number of names, like: Banding Girdle-band Girdling MS girdle You might feel it in your head, hands, or feet instead.. People with this type of sensation feel like they're wearing tight gloves or boots.. MS affects the way nerves send messages.. The tightness, pain, or whatever you're feeling results from spasms in small muscles between your ribs.. The doctor will call these intercostal muscles.. They hold your rib cage together and help it expand when you move, bend, or breathe.. If these muscles have spasms, you feel painful, tightening pressure.. The hug is a type of nerve pain.. You might hear a doctor call it dysesthesia, which means a sensation that isn't normal.. If other symptoms come on quickly at the same time, the hug can also be a sign that your MS is relapsing.. Call your doctor if this happens.. If you think you're having an MS hug, talk to your neurologist or main doctor right away.. The symptoms can seem like those of a heart attack, so it's important to make sure that's not the case and to rule out any other causes of the pressure.. Your doctor will most likely give you an MRI to look for other things, like gallbladder problems or lung disease.. MS hug can also happen to people with other rib and spinal cord conditions.. Yes.. The hug responds to the same triggers as other MS symptoms.. Keep notes and learn what sets yours off.. It might show up, or get worse if you're: Fighting a cold, flu, or bladder infection Fatigued Stressed out Too hot You may not need treatment.. But if you do, what your doctor gives you will depend on the cause.. If he thinks your symptoms signal a relapse, you might get steroids to help prevent it: Corticotropin ( Acthar, HP Acthar) Methylprednisone Prednisone Your doctor may suggest over-the-counter treatments like: Acetaminophen or ibuprofen Pain relief cream Or he could prescribe other medications, including: Drugs for depression that also fight nerve pain, such as amitriptyline ( Elavil) and duloxetine ( Cymbalta) Drugs that stop convulsions and also halt nerve pain, like gabapentin ( Neurontin) and pregabalin ( Lyrica) Muscle relaxers like baclofen ( Lioresal, Gablofen) Your health care team will work with you to choose the best mix of treatments for you.. You can try these things at home: Apply a warm compress.. ( Be careful: Heat might make your pain worse.). Drink plenty of water.. Eat healthy food.. Get a massage.. Stay rested.. Get at least 8 hours of sleep each night.. Use deep breathing techniques, yoga, and meditation.. Wear loose, comfortable clothing.. Wear tight clothes..

Data from the National Heart Association from 2012 shows 65% of people with diabetes will die from some sort of heart disease or stroke.. In general, the risk of heart disease death and stroke are twice as high in people with diabetes.. While all people with diabetes have an increased chance of developing heart disease, the condition is more common in those with type 2 diabetes.. In fact, heart disease is the number one cause of death among people with type 2 diabetes.. The Framingham Study was one of the first pieces of evidence to show that people with diabetes are more vulnerable to heart disease than those people who did not have diabetes.. The Framingham Study looked at generations of people, including those with diabetes, to try to determine the health risk factors for developing heart disease.. It showed that multiple health factors -- including diabetes -- could increase the possibility of developing heart disease.. Aside from diabetes, other health problems associated with heart disease include high blood pressure, smoking, high cholesterol levels, and a family history of early heart disease.. The more health risks factors a person has for heart disease, the higher the chances that they will develop heart disease and even die from it.. Just like anyone else, people with diabetes have an increased risk of dying from heart disease if they have more health risk factors.. However, the probability of dying from heart disease is 2 to 4 times higher in a person with diabetes.. So, while a person with one health risk factor, such as high blood pressure, may have a certain chance of dying from heart disease, a person with diabetes has double or even quadruple the risk of dying.. For example, one medical study found that people with diabetes who had no other health risk factors for heart disease were 5 times more likely to die of heart disease than those without.. Another medical study showed that people with diabetes, no matter the number of other heart disease risk factors, were as likely to have a heart attack as someone without diabetes who has already had a heart attack.. Heart disease experts recommend that all people with diabetes have their heart disease risk factors treated as aggressively as people who have already had heart attacks.. The most common cause of heart disease in a person with diabetes is hardening of thecoronary arteries or atherosclerosis, which is a buildup of cholesterol in the blood vessels that supply oxygen and nutrition to the heart.. When the cholesterol plaques can break apart or rupture, the body tries to repair the plaque rupture by sending platelets to seal it up.. Because the artery is small, the platelets could block the flow of blood, not allowing for oxygen delivery and a heart attack develops.. The same process can happen in all of the arteries in the body, resulting in lack of blood to the brain, causing a stroke or lack of blood to the feet, hands, or arms causing peripheral vascular disease.. Not only are people with diabetes at higher risk for heart disease, they're also at higher risk for heart failure, a serious medical condition in which the heart is unable to pump blood adequately.. This can lead to fluid build-up in the lungs that causes difficulty breathing, or fluid retention in other parts of the body (especially the legs) that causes swelling.. The symptoms of a heart attack include: Shortness of breath.. Feeling faint.. Feeling dizzy.. Excessive and unexplained sweating.. Pain in the shoulders, jaw, and left arm.. Chest pain or pressure (especially during activity).. Nausea.. Remember not everyone has pain and these other classic symptoms with a heart attack.. This is especially true for women.. * If you are experiencing any of these symptoms, you should call your doctor, call 911, or go to the nearest emergency room immediately.. Peripheral vascular disease has the following symptoms: Cramping in your legs while walking (intermittent claudication) or hips or buttocks pain Cold feet.. Decreased or absent pulses in the feet or legs.. Loss of fat under the skin of the lower parts of the legs.. Loss of hair on the lower parts of the legs.. There are several treatment options for heart disease in those with diabetes, depending on the severity of the heart disease, including: Aspirin therapy* to reduce the risks of clots that lead to heart attacks and strokes.. Diet.. Exercise not only for weight loss, but to improve blood sugar levels, high blood pressure, cholesterol levels and to decrease abdominal fat, a risk factor of heart disease.. Medicines.. Surgery.. Peripheral vascular disease is treated by: Participation in a regular walking program (45 minutes per day, followed by rest) Special footwear Aiming for an A1c below 7% Lowering your blood pressure to less than 130/80 Getting your cholesterol to below 100 Aspirin therapy* Medicines Stopping smoking Surgery (in some cases) * Low-dose aspirin therapy is recommended for men and women with types 1 or 2 diabetes who are over age 40 and areat high risk for heart disease and peripheral vascular disease.. Talk to your doctor to determine if aspirin therapy is right for you.. If you have certain medical conditions, aspirin therapy may not be recommended.. The best way to prevent heart disease is to take good care of yourself and your diabetes.. Keep your blood sugar as normal as possible.. Control your blood pressure, with medication if necessary.. The target for people with diabetes is under 130/80.. Get your cholesterol numbers under control.. You may need to take medication to do this.. Lose weight if you are obese..

It sounds hard when you're already tired, but moving around actually gives you energy.. It boosts your mood, too.. If your doctor gives you the green light, start with a 10-minute walk, and build up to 30 minutes of moderate activity on most days of the week.. Manage stress.. Try yoga, meditation, or other relaxation techniques on a regular basis.. Or simply make time for things you enjoy.. Get enough rest.. You might find your hep C medicine makes it hard to sleep.. Try these tips to get better shut-eye: Don't watch TV (or text or read) in bed.. Go to sleep and get up at the same time every day.. Keep your bedroom cool and quiet.. Don't drink caffeine late in the day.. If you still can't sleep, talk to your doctor.. Sleeping pills may give you some short-term help.. Studies disagree about whether the hepatitis C virus itself causes fatigue.. But two things are clear.. If you have scarring of the liver, called cirrhosis, you're more likely to get tired.. And taking interferon, sometimes a part of treatment, can rob you of energy.. But if you go through treatment and get cured, your fatigue will get better.. If you're having trouble with daily activities because you're too tired, talk to your doctor about your medication options.. You might be able to take newer drugs instead of interferon to wipe out the virus more quickly, so you don't have to deal with side effects for so long.. Anyone with a long-lasting illness can get depressed.. Hepatitis C is no different.. You may be angry, anxious, or sad about your health or the changes you've had to make in your life.. Your doctor can help.. Tell him how you're feeling.. He may prescribe an antidepressant.. He can also help you find a therapist or support group, where you can talk to others who are facing the same problems as you.",[]
57,What can I tell from the ingredients section of a food label?,"The serving size and the number of servings in the package are important to consider when reading a food label. Additionally, the order of the ingredients on a food label indicates the relative weight of each ingredient.","[['food label', 'helps in', 'making decisions'], ['food label', 'contains', 'serving size'], ['serving size', 'determines', 'amounts listed'], ['amounts listed', 'includes', 'calories'], ['calories', 'measures', 'energy'], ['ingredients section', 'lists', 'components'], ['components', 'indicates', 'relative weight'], ['first ingredient', 'makes up', 'largest proportion'], ['last ingredient', 'makes up', 'least amount']]","The ingredients section of a food label lists all the components of a food product in order from the largest to smallest amount, by weight. This means that the first ingredient listed is the one that makes up the largest proportion of the food, and the last ingredient listed makes up the least. Some labels may also include additional information such as percentages of daily recommended values for various nutrients, serving sizes, and calorie counts, among other things. By examining both the ingredients list and the nutritional information, you can get a better understanding of the nutritional content of a food and how it fits into your diet. Keep in mind that some food labels may contain claims such as ""low cholesterol"" or ""low fat,"" which have specific definitions set by the government, and that the serving size listed on the label may not be the same as the portion size you consume. Therefore, it's important to carefully read and interpret the information on food labels to","[['food label', 'gives', 'nutritional information'], ['nutritional information', 'includes', 'serving size'], ['serving size', 'standard measurement', 'food'], ['standard measurement', 'determines', 'amounts listed'], ['amounts listed', 'includes', 'calories'], ['calories', 'measures', 'energy'], ['nutritional information', 'helps in', 'choosing foods'], ['choosing foods', 'helps in', 'managing diet'], ['managing diet', 'includes', 'controlling blood sugar'], ['managing diet', 'includes', 'controlling cholesterol'], ['managing diet', 'includes', 'controlling blood pressure'], ['managing diet', 'includes', 'weight management']]","Food labels can help you make better decisions about what you eat and how you manage your diabetes.. Just about every packaged food made in the U. S. has a "" Nutrition Facts"" label that gives a serving size and other nutritional information.. It has measurements of fat, cholesterol, sodium, carbohydrates, protein, vitamins, and minerals for a typical amount of that food.. This information can make it easier for you to choose foods that will fit into your meal plan and help control your blood sugar, cholesterol, blood pressure, and weight.. Here's an example of a Nutrition Facts label.. Find out more about its parts below.. A serving size is a standard measurement based on the amount of food people typically have at one time.. The size of the serving determines the amounts listed on the label.. It helps you figure how many calories and nutrients are in your food on your plate.. Pay attention to that serving size, including the number of servings in the package, and compare it to how much you're actually eating.. Don't confuse portion size with serving size.. A portion is what you choose to eat -- and there are no standard measures for this.. For example, if a slice of bread is a serving size and you eat a sandwich with two slices of bread, you've had two servings of bread in your one portion, so you'll have to double all the nutritional numbers like calories and carbs.. If a package has four servings and you eat the whole thing (like a bag of crunchy snacks), you get 4 times the calories, fat, and everything else listed on the label.. Calories measure energy, so this number tells you how much energy you get from one serving.. ( Remember, you'll need to adjust this if your portion is different from the serving size on the label.). This part of the label also tells you how much of that energy comes from the fat in a serving.. ""% Daily Value"" shows how much a serving of that food gives you for each key nutrient listed.. These daily goals are set by the government, based on current nutrition recommendations.. The percentages are based on a 2,000 calorie/day diet, which would be right for an average- or large-size man who gets little exercise.. Women or seniors with diabetes, or people trying to lose weight, need fewer calories.. If your daily calorie intake isn't 2,000, you may need to do a little math.. Some nutrient goals change with the number of daily calories.. Some, including sodium and calcium, are based on things like your age, sex, or health, not the number of calories you eat.. Talk to your doctor or your diabetes educator about how to adjust the % Daily Values on labels for your diet.. In general, when it comes to fat, saturated fat, cholesterol, and sodium, choose foods with a low % Daily Value.. For total carbohydrates, dietary fiber, and vitamins and minerals, try to reach your daily target for each nutrient.. Every product should list all the ingredients in it.. They're in order from the largest to smallest amount, by weight.. This means a food is made up of the heaviest amount of the first ingredient and the least amount of the last ingredient.. Some food labels make claims such as ""low cholesterol"" or ""low fat."". A manufacturer can only use these words if a food meets strict government definitions: LABEL CLAIM DEFINITION (per standard serving size) Fat-free* or sugar-free Less than 0.5 gram (g) of fat or sugar Low fat 3 g of fat or less Reduced fat or reduced sugar At least 25% less fat or sugar than the regular product..

How can you keep flares at bay?. Learn all you can, including: What causes it Your triggers Which treatments work best The latest about Crohn's and meds that can ease it The warning signs of a flare and what can help prevent one Your doctor can be a great resource, too.. When you visit, come with questions.. Even if your symptoms are gone and you feel great, don't stop taking your prescribed drugs unless your doctor tells you to.. People who don't stick to their drug plan are more likely to get flares.. That can cause problems.. Repeated flares can lead to things like narrowing of your intestines.. Or you might get fistulas, which are abnormal connections between the intestines and your skin or other organs.. If a drug causes side effects that bother you, don't just stop taking it.. Talk to your doctor first.. You might need to take a lower dose, switch to another drug, or get treatment for the side effects.. When your Crohn's disease flares, it can be hard for your small intestine to take in nutrients.. So when you don't have symptoms, it's really important to eat healthy.. Keep a food diary.. It can show you if certain choices make your symptoms worse.. For some people with Crohn's, high-fat foods or fiber-rich fruits and vegetables (like beans and broccoli) cause problems.. When you figure out which foods might make you feel bad, let your health care team know.. Along with a diet expert, they can help you plan meals that include all the food groups.. You might also need to take supplements of vitamins B12 and D, iron, or calcium, or a multivitamin.. You already know that smoking is bad for you..

It is manufactured in a way that makes it last longer in the body. Common side effects include flu-like symptoms, injection site reactions, and mood changes. Women who are pregnant, breastfeeding, or planning to get pregnant should not use interferon drugs, and should consult their doctor about any changes in mood or other symptoms.","[['Plegridy', 'approved_for', 'relapsing_forms_of_multiple_sclerosis'], ['Plegridy', 'given_frequency', 'every_2_weeks'], ['interferon_beta', 'type_of', 'Plegridy'], ['Plegridy', 'reduces', 'frequency_of_exacerbations'], ['Plegridy', 'stabilizes', 'course_of_disease']]","Your body makes interferons naturally..

When you take these medicines, you might have other health problems, such as: Flu-like symptoms, such as fatigue, chills, fever, muscle aches, and sweating during the first weeks of treatment.. To keep those from slowing you down, it's best to take the shot at bedtime.. You can take pain and fever relievers, like acetaminophen or ibuprofen, before each injection and during the 24 hours after one to help relieve these problems..

When you have anemia, your body doesn't make enough red blood cells, or these cells don't work as well as they should.. You end up feeling weak, tired, and short of breath.. Anemia comes in many forms.. Iron-deficiency anemia is most common.. Other types of the disease affect only small numbers of people.. Here's a look at some of the rare types of anemia and how they're treated.. Blood cells are made from stem cells in your bone marrow.. When you have aplastic anemia, stem cells in your bone marrow are damaged and can't make enough new blood cells.. You're either born with aplastic anemia, meaning you inherited a gene from your parents that caused it, or you develop it (acquired).. Acquired aplastic anemia is the more common of the two, and sometimes it's only temporary.. Acquired causes include: Autoimmune diseases such as lupus and rheumatoid arthritis Chemicals such as pesticides, arsenic, and benzene Infections including hepatitis, Epstein- Barr virus, and HIV Radiation and chemotherapy treatments for cancer Inherited conditions such as Fanconi anemia, Shwachman- Diamond syndrome, and Diamond- Blackfan anemia, can damage cells and also cause aplastic anemia.. Symptoms of aplastic anemia can include everything from shortness of breath and dizziness to headaches, pale skin, chest pain, fast heart rate (tachycardia), and cold hands and feet.. One way to treat aplastic anemia is with a blood transfusion.. You'll get a donor's blood through a vein.. A stem cell transplant also treats aplastic anemia.. It replaces the damaged stem cells in your bone marrow with healthy cells.. In this group of blood disorders, your body can't use iron to make hemoglobin -- the protein that carries oxygen in your blood.. The iron buildup causes the formation of abnormal red blood cells called sideroblasts.. There are two main types of sideroblastic anemia: Acquired sideroblastic anemia can be caused by exposure to certain chemicals or drugs.. Hereditary sideroblastic anemia happens when a gene mutation disrupts normal hemoglobin production.. This gene produces âheme,â the part of hemoglobin that carries oxygen.. Symptoms for both types include: Chest pain Fast heartbeat, or tachycardia Headaches Trouble breathing Weakness and fatigue Treatment for sideroblastic anemia depends on the cause.. If you have acquired anemia, you'll need to avoid the chemical or drug that caused it.. Other treatments include vitamin B6 therapy and bone marrow or stem cell transplants.. Myelodysplastic syndromes ( MDS) are diseases that are caused when your bone marrow is damaged and can't make enough healthy blood cells.. MDS is a type of cancer.. Some people are born with a gene that causes MDS.. These genes are usually passed down from one or both parents.. If you have certain inherited syndromes, including Fanconi anemia, Shwachman- Diamond syndrome, Diamond Blackfan anemia, familial platelet disorder, and severe congenital neutropenia, you could be more likely to develop MDS.. A small number of people also get MDS after radiation or chemotherapy treatment for cancer.. Another risk is exposure to chemicals like benzene, which is found in tobacco smoke.. Some people don't have symptoms with MDS, but others do, including: Bruising or bleeding Infection Fever Shortness of breath Weakness and fatigue Weight loss Oncologists (cancer doctors) and hematologists (blood doctors) treat MDS with chemotherapy, hematopoietic growth factors, and stem cell or bone marrow transplants.. Autoimmune hemolytic anemia happens when your body's immune system attacks and destroys red blood cells faster than it can make new ones.. If you have an autoimmune disease like lupus, you're also more likely to get this type of anemia.. Medicines such as methyldopa ( Aldomet), penicillin, and quinine ( Qualaquin) can also cause autoimmune hemolytic anemia.. Symptoms include fatigue, pale skin, fast heartbeat (tachycardia), trouble breathing, chills, backache, and yellow skin (jaundice).. Treating the disease that caused the anemia can also stop your red blood cell damage.. If you have an autoimmune disease, your doctor might treat you with steroid drugs to calm your immune system, which can help the anemia.. CDA is a group of inherited anemias that reduce the number of healthy red blood cells in the body.. All CDAs are passed down through families.. There are three types of CDA, types 1, 2, and 3.. Type 2 is the most common and type 3 is the rarest.. Symptoms include chronic anemia, fatigue, yellow skin and eyes (jaundice), pale skin, and missing fingers and toes at birth.. Some people never need treatment.. But depending on the severity of the disease, your doctor might recommend a blood transfusion, a stem cell transplant, or with medicines to lower iron levels or interferon alfa-2 A, a drug typically used for treating leukemia and melanoma.. If you have Diamond- Blackfan anemia, your bone marrow doesn't make enough red blood cells.. Doctors think it is caused by changes to your genes.. Symptoms of Diamond- Blackfan anemia include: Fast heartbeat (tachycardia) Fatigue Heart murmur Pale skin Short height Weak bones Treatments include everything from steroids that can help produce more red blood cells to red blood cell transfusions and bone marrow transplants.. With this type of anemia, your bone marrow produces abnormally structured red blood cells that are too large and too young.. Because they're not mature or healthy, they can't carry oxygen throughout your body very well.. Megaloblastic anemia is caused by too little vitamin B12 (cobalamin) or vitamin B9 (folate).. Your body needs these vitamins to make red blood cells.. Some people with megaloblastic anemia might not have symptoms for many years.. But once symptoms do appear, they're similar to other types of anemia, and include: Dizziness and fatigue Diarrhea, nausea Fast or irregular heartbeat (tachycardia) Muscle pain or weakness Pale skin Trouble breathing Doctors treat megaloblastic anemia with vitamin B9 and vitamin B12 supplements to replace what your body is missing.. You'll also need treatment for any disease -- such as Crohn's -- that caused your body to lack these vitamins.. Fanconi anemia makes your blood marrow produce too few blood cells.. It's hereditary, meaning it's passed down from one of your parents through a gene mutation.. Symptoms of Fanconi anemia include: Abnormal thumbs Heart, kidney, and bone problems Skin color changes Small body, head, and eyes If you have Fanconi anemia, you're more likely to get a type of cancer called acute myeloid leukemia, or AML.. Your odds of getting cancers of the head, neck, skin, GI tract, or genitals also go up.. Treatment depends on several factors, including what stage it's in and the severity of physical complications.. Treatments include hormone therapy and growth factors to boost blood cell growth.. If symptoms become severe, your doctor might recommend a bone marrow stem cell transplant.. Oftentimes a bone marrow transplant can cure the problems altogether.","[['Megaloblastic anemia', 'can_be_caused_by', ""['genetic_disorders', 'diseases', 'exposure_to_toxins']""], ['genetic_disorders', 'include', ""['Fanconi_anemia', 'Shwachman-Diamond_syndrome', 'Diamond-Blackfan_anemia']""], ['Fanconi_anemia', 'is_a_genetic_disorder_that_affects', 'bone_marrow'], ['bone_marrow', 'responsible_for_producing', 'red_blood_cells'], ['Fanconi_anemia', 'causes_symptoms', ""['abnormal_thumbs', 'heart_kidney_and_bone_problems', 'skin_color_changes', 'small_body_head_and_eyes']""], ['Fanconi_anemia', 'increases_risk_of_developing', 'acute_myeloid_leukemia']]"

They'll help your body get used to that allergen.. It may take a year before they really start to work.. Skin conditions: Atopic and contact dermatitis can be treated with a variety of anti-inflammatory steroids.. You can put them on your skin or take them by mouth.. Mild cases of hives may not need treatment.. But moderate to severe cases require antihistamines or steroid pills.. Stomach medicines that have some antihistamine effect, like ranitidine, may also help.. Angioedema, a swelling that sometimes comes with them, is almost always treated.. It can be life-threatening.. Respiratory allergies: Doctors treat allergic rhinitis, or hay fever, with corticosteroid sprays or antihistamines.. They work well over the long term, but you have to take them regularly.. You can get three kinds -- budesonide, fluticasone, and triamcinolone -- over the counter.. Over-the-counter antihistamines such as cetirizine, fexofenadine, and loratadine can help.. You can also take a once-a-day med called a leukotriene receptor antagonist.. Allergy shots work well after the first year.. Another treatment that gives you a bit of the allergen is available in tablets or drops that you place under your tongue.. Food allergies: Your best bet is to stay away from the problem food.. If your reaction is mild -- the food makes you itch or makes your eyes water -- antihistamines or topical creams might be all you need.. If you're highly allergic and likely to go into anaphylactic shock, your doctor will prescribe an emergency kit and show you how to use it.. Keep two with you at all times.. They contain a preloaded epinephrine shot.. If you think you're having an emergency, don't wait to take it.. Then call 911.. Drug allergies: If you're allergic to medications, wear a Medic Alert bracelet.. Always discuss this allergy with doctors when they give you a new prescription.. Some skin rashes caused by drug allergies respond to antihistamines.. Others require steroids you take by mouth or rub onto your skin.. An allergy specialist can help you get used to some antibiotics.. Insect sting allergies: Again, the best thing is to try to avoid getting stung.. But allergy shots can make a reaction less severe.. If you're highly allergic and anaphylaxis is a possibility, your doctor will prescribe an emergency kit with an epinephrine shot.. Carry two with you at all times if your doctor prescribes them.. Use one in case of an emergency, then call 911.","[['Your doctor', 'asks for', 'personal and family medical history'], ['Your doctor', 'asks for', 'allergens you might have come in contact with']]"
62,How do timers help children under age five behave?,"Parents find that using timers can help children under the age of five behave better. By setting a reasonable time limit for activities, such as bath time or playtime, children learn to expect limitations and to finish tasks on time. Parents can also reward their children for completing chores on time, which further reinforces the desired behavior.","[['Parents', 'help_children_behave_better', 'children_under_five'], ['children_under_five', 'learn_behavior', 'using_timers'], ['using_timers', 'help_children_understand', 'limitations'], ['limitations', 'provide_structure', 'activities_and_chores'], ['activities_and_chores', 'have_set_duration', 'bath_time_or_playtime']]","Timers help children under age five by providing structure and training them to expect limitations, even on fun things. Using a timer for activities such as bath time or playtime can help children understand that certain activities have a set duration, and can help them learn to wait for their next activity or reward. Additionally, using a timer for chores can help children associate completing a task with a reward, and can help parents enforce consistent consequences for misbehavior.","[['Timers', 'help_children_under_age_five', 'learn_behavior'], ['learning_behavior', 'understand_limitations', 'even_on_fun_things'], ['using_timers_for', 'activities_such_as', 'bath_time_or_playtime'], ['clear_instructions_for', 'tasks', 'given_before_activity'], ['reward_children_for', 'completing_tasks', 'on_time'], ['consistent_consequences_for', 'misbehavior', 'enforced']]","Whether your child with ADHD is young or a teen, you can show them you're firm but fair (and fun) by doing two key things.. Encourage good behavior with praise or rewards immediately.. Make consequences for bad behavior clear, understood, and consistent.. Your approach will depend on your child's age.. Organize the day.. Have a routine.. Let your child know if it's changing or if something unusual is going to happen, like a visit from a relative or a vacation.. Set rules and expectations.. It's best to do this right before an activity or situation.. Use rewards.. If your child does something you're proud of, give him a gold star, or give him time for his favorite hobby.. Try not to use money, food, or candy for rewards.. Engage your child with mind-building activities, such as reading, games, and puzzles.. Join in!. Use a timer.. Some parents find this helps build structure.. For example, set a reasonable time limit for a bath or playtime.. It helps train your child to expect limitations, even on fun things.. Give your child a time limit for doing a chore, too, especially if you reward her for finishing on time.. Explain and instruct.. Give clear instructions for tasks.. If a chore is hard or lengthy, break it down into steps that can be done one at a time.. Reward your child for good behavior and tasks completed.. Have a clear system for incentives (like a point system or gold stars) so your child knows what to expect when they finish a chore or behave better.. Be consistent with your expectations, and always follow through with rewards.. Make a plan for discipline.. Set up a specific consequence for a certain misbehavior.. Be consistent and fair about enforcing it.. Try not to discipline your child in front of others.. Talk regularly with your child's teachers, so you can deal with any behavior concerns before they become a major problem.. Walk your talk.. Set a good example for your child.. Children with ADHD need role models for good behavior.. Involve them.. As your child matures, let them help set expectations, rewards, and consequences.. This empowers them, which may improve their self-esteem and reinforce the idea that they're in charge of their own behavior.. This will also help them become more responsible as they move toward young adulthood.. Discipline in private.. Teenagers are often sensitive of how they appear to others.. So they may overreact or feel ashamed if you discipline them in public.. The teen years can be tough for any kid, so be gentle and understanding.. Talk with them about any issues they're having.. Talk with your teen's teachers when issues in the classroom come up.. Talk with your child, too.. Make a plan to deal with it, together.. Be predictable.. Be consistent and fair with how you act.. That way, your teen knows what to expect from you.. Set a good example.. Teens don't always show it, but the adults in their lives are very influential and important to them.. All parents find themselves frustrated at times, and raising a child with ADHD has its own set of challenges.. It's natural to have needs and questions.. When you're feeling overwhelmed, talk to someone about it.. Look for a support group, or see a mental health professional to help you deal with your emotions and reactions so you can be a more effective parent.. Family counseling may help, too.","[['Parents', 'show_firm_but_fair_approach', 'children_with_ADHD'], ['encourage_good_behavior_with', 'praise_or_rewards', 'immediately'], ['make_consequences_clear_and_consistent', 'understood', 'misbehavior'], ['mind_building_activities', 'engage_children_with', 'reading_games_and_puzzles']]"

Prednisone and other steroids (inhaled, oral, or by injection) help calm airway inflammation in asthma.. If you've ever had a serious asthma attack, you may have had high doses of steroids in the hospital administered intravenously.. Prednisone is an oral steroid medication.. If you have serious worsening of asthma symptoms (an asthma attack), your doctor may prescribe a brief course of oral steroids such as prednisone.. Oral steroids may also be prescribed when your asthma symptoms worsen but you do not require hospitalization.. Oral prednisone is a systemic anti-inflammatory steroid.. That means that after taking prednisone by mouth (orally), it is absorbed in the body, unlike inhaled steroids (anti-inflammatory asthma inhalers) that go straight to the lungs.. Prednisone decreases your immune system's response to reduce symptoms such as swelling and allergic-type reactions.. Prednisone and other systemic steroids may be used to treat asthma attacks and help people gain better asthma control.. Steroids are used with other asthma medications to either control sudden and severe asthma attacks or to treat long-term, hard-to-control asthma.. Sometimes systemic steroids like prednisone are taken in high doses for a few days.. This is called a steroid burst.. They may also be given in a low dose daily or every other day for long-term asthma control.. Besides prednisone, other systemic steroids used in the treatment of asthma include: Medrol, Methylpred, Solu- Medrol (methylprednisolone) Deltasone (prednisone) Prelone, Pediapred, Orapred, (prednisolone) Decadron (dexamethasone) While a two-week course or ""short burst"" of oral steroids like prednisone is relatively safe, it's important to avoid steroids on a long-term basis as there are potential serious side effects.. Taking supplemental calcium may help to prevent osteoporosis or thinning of the bones, which is one of the side effects of long-term steroid use.. If you need steroids frequently for ""rescue"" therapy, this can suggest poor control of airway inflammation or continued exposure to some unsuspected allergen.. In this case, talk to your health care provider about inhaled anti-inflammatory medications.. Steroids have many potential side effects, especially when given orally and for a long period of time.. Side effects with short-term steroid use include: Weight gain Fluid retention High blood pressure Elevated blood sugar Side effects with long-term steroid use include: Growth suppression Diabetes Cataracts of the eyes Bone-thinning osteoporosis Muscle weakness Anti-inflammatory asthma inhalers are often used as a first-line controller treatment for asthma.. After introduction of inhaled steroids, the need for oral steroids such as prednisone may decrease.. Unlike the serious side effects of oral steroids, the most common side effects of anti-inflammatory asthma inhalers are hoarseness and thrush, especially in elderly adults.. As with all asthma inhalers, you should rinse the mouth carefully after using your inhaler.. Gargle with water after inhalation to help reduce the risk of oral thrush..

Your cells need it to survive.. If your blood flow gets blocked anywhere, it can bring big trouble.. One serious effect is a problem called a transient ischemic attack, or TIA for short.. When you have a TIA, the flow of blood to part of your brain gets cut off for a short time.. It's also called a ministroke, but don't let the ""mini"" part fool you.. A TIA can be a sign that a full-blown stroke is on the way.. About 1 in 3 people who have a TIA go on to have a stroke, often within a year.. TIAs are short and won't cause lasting damage, but it's still important to treat them like an emergency and get care right away.. TIAs typically happen because a blood clot gets lodged in an artery that supplies blood to the brain.. Without regular blood flow, your brain is starved for oxygen and can't work like it normally does.. That's why you get symptoms like muscle weakness or slurred speech.. It'd be like having a clogged fuel line in your car.. Your engine can't run if it's not getting gas.. Clots form when you have a buildup of a fatty, waxy substance called plaque in your arteries.. They can take shape anywhere in your body and float along until they get stuck somewhere.. If that ""somewhere"" happens to be an artery that goes to your brain, you can have a TIA.. You can also get a TIA if so much plaque builds up in an artery that it severely limits blood flow to the brain, just like a clot.. TIAs are very similar to ischemic strokes, which are also caused by blood clots.. The main difference is that a TIA only lasts a few minutes.. The clot then gets pushed along, like a temporary clog in a pipe, or chemicals in your body quickly break it down.. Normal blood flow returns to your brain before any lasting problems set in.. Symptoms can last for up to 24 hours, but they're usually gone in an hour.. Strokes, on the other hand, don't go away so quickly.. That means some part of your brain goes without oxygen, and the longer that lasts, the more damage happens.. While a TIA comes on, goes away, and leaves no symptoms, a stroke can have long-lasting effects and can be life-threatening.. The same things that raise your odds of a stroke also affect your risk of a TIA, and there are a lot of issues in play.. Risks you can't control.. Some things you can't change, but it's helpful to be aware of them: Age.. The odds of a TIA or stroke get much higher when you're over 55.. Family history.. If one of your grandparents, parents, or a brother or sister had a stroke, you have a greater chance of getting a TIA.. Previous TIA.. Once you've had one, you're much more likely to get another.. Race.. African- Americans, as well as people who belong to South Asian and Caribbean ethnic groups, have a higher chance of a TIA than others.. Gender.. Women have a greater risk of strokes and TIAs than men.. Health conditions.. Other medical problems you have can also increase the odds of a TIA, including: Being overweight Carotid artery disease, where the main arteries from your heart to your brain are narrowed or clogged Diabetes Heart disease, including heart defects and rhythm problems like atrial fibrillation ( AFib) High blood pressure High cholesterol Peripheral artery disease ( PAD), where arteries in your arms or legs get blocked Sickle cell disease, a genetic condition where misshaped blood cells can get wedged in arteries more easily Lifestyle.. Some of the choices you make every day may also affect your chances of having a TIA.. You may have a higher risk if you: Drink a lot of alcohol Don't get enough exercise Eat too many foods high in cholesterol, saturated fats, and trans fats, and not enough fruits, veggies, and fiber Smoke Use drugs such as amphetamines, cocaine, and heroin Risks for women.. Odds of a TIA may be higher for women who: Are pregnant, since pregnancy can raise your blood pressure and make your heart work harder Get migraines with auras Take birth control pills, especially if you smoke or have high blood pressure Use hormone replacement therapy ( HRT) to treat menopause symptoms","[['TIA', 'is_a', 'Transient Ischemic Attack'], ['Transient Ischemic Attack', 'is_a', 'Cerebrovascular Event'], ['Transient Ischemic Attack', 'is_associated_with', 'Blood clot'], ['Blood clot', 'is_a', 'Thrombus'], ['Transient Ischemic Attack', 'is_associated_with', 'Artery'], ['Artery', 'is_a', 'Blood vessel'], ['Transient Ischemic Attack', 'is_associated_with', 'Brain'], ['Brain', 'is_a', 'Organ'], ['Transient Ischemic Attack', 'is_associated_with', 'Oxygen deprivation'], ['Oxygen deprivation', 'is_a', 'Hypoxia'], ['Transient Ischemic Attack', 'is_associated_with', 'Symptoms'], ['Symptoms', 'is_a', 'Medical symptom'], ['Transient Ischemic Attack', 'is_associated_with', 'Muscle weakness'], ['Muscle weakness', 'is_a', 'Paralysis'], ['Transient Ischemic Attack', 'is_associated_with', 'Slurred speech'], ['Slurred speech', 'is_a', 'Dysarthria'], ['Transient Ischemic Attack', 'is_associated_with', 'Lasting damage'], ['Lasting damage', 'is_a', 'Neurological damage'], ['Transient Ischemic Attack', 'is_associated_with', 'Risk factors'], ['Risk factors', 'is_a', 'Predisposing factor'], ['Transient Ischemic Attack', 'is_associated_with', 'Age'], ['Age', 'is_a', 'Numerical value'], ['Transient Ischemic Attack', 'is_associated_with', 'Family history'], ['Family history', 'is_a', 'Personal history'], ['Transient Ischemic Attack', 'is_associated_with', 'Race'], ['Race', 'is_a', 'Demographic'], ['Transient Ischemic Attack', 'is_associated_with', 'Gender'], ['Gender', 'is_a', 'Sex'], ['Transient Ischemic Attack', 'is_associated_with', 'Being overweight'], ['Being overweight', 'is_a', 'Obesity'], ['Transient Ischemic Attack', 'is_associated_with', 'Carotid artery disease'], ['Carotid artery disease', 'is_a', 'Atherosclerosis'], ['Transient Ischemic Attack', 'is_associated_with', 'Diabetes'], ['Diabetes', 'is_a', 'Chronic disease'], ['Transient Ischemic Attack', 'is_associated_with', 'Heart disease'], ['Heart disease', 'is_a', 'Cardiovascular disease'], ['Transient Ischemic Attack', 'is_associated_with', 'High blood pressure'], ['High blood pressure', 'is_a', 'Hypertension'], ['Transient Ischemic Attack', 'is_associated_with', 'High cholesterol'], ['High cholesterol', 'is_a', 'Lipid disorder'], ['Transient Ischemic Attack', 'is_associated_with', 'Peripheral artery disease'], ['Peripheral artery disease', 'is_a', 'Peripheral vascular disease'], ['Transient Ischemic Attack', 'is_associated_with', 'Sickle cell disease'], ['Sickle cell disease', 'is_a', 'Genetic disorder'], ['Transient Ischemic Attack', 'is_associated_with', 'Alcohol consumption'], ['Alcohol consumption', 'is_a', 'Drinking'], ['Transient Ischemic Attack', 'is_associated_with', 'Lack of exercise'], ['Lack of exercise', 'is_a', 'Inactivity'], ['Transient Ischemic Attack', 'is_associated_with', 'Unhealthy diet'], ['Unhealthy diet', 'is_a', 'Malnutrition'], ['Transient Ischemic Attack', 'is_associated_with', 'Smoking'], ['Smoking', 'is_a', 'Tobacco use'], ['Transient Ischemic Attack', 'is_associated_with', 'Drug usage'], ['Drug usage', 'is_a', 'Substance abuse'], ['Transient Ischemic Attack', 'is_associated_with', 'Pregnancy'], ['Pregnancy', 'is_a', 'Reproductive process'], ['Transient Ischemic Attack', 'is_associated_with', 'Migraines with auras'], ['Migraines with auras', 'is_a', 'Migraine'], ['Transient Ischemic Attack', 'is_associated_with', 'Birth control pill usage'], ['Birth control pill usage', 'is_a', 'Contraceptive use'], ['Transient Ischemic Attack', 'is_associated_with', 'Hormone replacement therapy usage'], ['Hormone replacement therapy usage', 'is_a', 'Hormone therapy'], ['TIA', 'is_associated_with', 'Stroke'], ['Stroke', 'is_a', 'Cerebrovascular Event'], ['TIA', 'is_associated_with', 'Lasting damage'], ['Lasting damage', 'is_associated_with', 'Disability'], ['Disability', 'is_a', 'Impairment'], ['TIA', 'is_associated_with', 'Emergency care'], ['Emergency care', 'is_a', 'Healthcare'], ['TIA', 'is_associated_with', 'Emergency department'], ['Emergency department', 'is_a', 'Healthcare facility']]"

Steroids can weaken bones, so regular bone mineral density tests, calcium and vitamin D supplements, along with a prescription drug called a bisphosphonate may be suggested to slow down or prevent bone damage. Other medications, like methotrexate and tocilizumab, may be used along with steroids to lessen the amount of steroids required. Aspirin may also be given to thin the blood and prevent clots. Regular blood tests are done to monitor the progression of the disease and adjust treatment accordingly.","[['Temporal arteritis', 'causes', 'inflammation_in_arteries'], ['inflammation_in_arteries', 'slows_down', 'blood_flow'], ['symptoms_of_temporal_arteritis', 'include', 'headaches'], ['symptoms_of_temporal_arteritis', 'include', 'pain_in_face_and_joints'], ['symptoms_of_temporal_arteritis', 'include', 'vision_problems'], ['treatment_for_temporal_arteritis', 'includes', 'high_doses_of_steroids'], ['high_doses_of_steroids', 'lasts_for', '1_to_2_years'], ['steroids_can_cause_side_effects', 'include', 'bone_damage'], ['bone_damage_prevention', 'includes', 'bone_mineral_density_tests'], ['bone_damage_prevention', 'includes', 'calcium_and_vitamin_D_supplements'], ['bone_damage_prevention', 'includes', 'bisphosphonates'], ['other_medications', 'include', 'methotrexate'], ['other_medications', 'include', 'tocilizumab']]","Temporal arteritis is a disease that causes your arteries -- blood vessels that carry oxygen from your heart to the rest of your body -- to become inflamed.. It usually happens to the large and medium-sized temporal arteries that run along both sides of your head.. The cells of these inflamed arteries look huge under a microscope.. That is why temporal arteritis is also called giant cell arteritis.. The swelling slows blood flow through your arteries, and that can cause symptoms like headaches and pain in your face and joints.. Left untreated, narrowed arteries can cause vision problems and blindness.. Medication can help your symptoms and prevent serious health issues.. It's an autoimmune disease.. That means your immune system mistakenly attacks your body's healthy tissues.. In temporal arteritis, immune cells react against blood vessels and make them inflamed.. Doctors don't know what triggers this, but you're more likely to get it if you're: Over 50 Female Of European descent -- especially if your family is from a country in Scandinavia ( Norway, Sweden, Denmark, or Finland) One of the main symptoms of temporal arteritis is a headache you feel in your temples and scalp.. The pain can be severe.. Other symptoms may include: Fever Fatigue Pain in your jaw when you chew Pain in your face Vision problems such as blurred vision, double vision, or sudden vision loss Pain in your shoulders, arms, neck, and hip Appetite loss Weight loss Cough Sore throat Tongue pain If you notice these symptoms, let your doctor know.. About half of people with temporal arteritis have polymyalgia rheumatica ( PMR) as well.. PMR is an inflammatory condition that also causes swelling, but in your joints.. Symptoms include stiffness and aching in your arms, neck, lower back, and thighs.. It can be treated with medication and usually goes away within a few years.. It's not clear how or why the two conditions are related.. Your doctor will do an exam and ask about your symptoms.. They'll also look for swelling and a weak pulse in the temporal artery in your scalp.. You may need a biopsy of the temporal artery.. If so, your doctor will numb an area of your scalp and remove a small piece of the temporal artery.. A doctor will then check it under a microscope.. The cells of an inflamed artery look very large under the microscope.. Your doctor also might do one or more of these: Blood test.. A sample is taken to check for signs of inflammation in your body.. CT scan (computerized tomography).. Several X-rays taken from different angles are put together to show more information about your arteries.. MRI scan (magnetic resonance imaging).. Powerful magnets and radio waves are used to make detailed images of your arteries.. When arteries are inflamed, blood can't move as easily through them.. Temporal arteritis can keep oxygen from getting to your eyes, and this can damage them.. You might need to see an eye doctor to check for this.. If you have temporal arteritis, your doctor will start you on medication right away to prevent vision loss and other problems.. The main treatment is high doses of steroids, such as prednisone, to reduce inflammation in the arteries.. You'll take this medication by mouth every day.. Most people stay on a steroid for 1 to 2 years.. Your doctor will do blood tests every few months to see if the inflammation in your arteries has gone down.. As it does, your doctor will lower the dose of your medicine.. These medications can weaken your bones, so your doctor might suggest regular bone mineral density tests.. Your doctor may suggest you take calcium and vitamin D supplements, along with a prescription drug called a bisphosphonate, to slow down or prevent bone damage.. Other medications that may be used include methotrexate, a drug commonly used to treat cancer as well as rheumatoid arthritis and psoriasis, and a biologic drug called tocilizumab ( Actemra).. Tocilizumab is given as an injection under the skin to lessen the amount of steroids a person needs.. This medicine may be used along with steroids..

66,How can avoiding smoking help you  prevent hearing loss?,"Research shows that smoking can increase your risk of hearing loss. If you smoke, quitting is one way to help prevent hearing loss. Additionally, if you are not a smoker, you should avoid breathing secondhand smoke.","[['Research', 'shows', 'increased_risk_of_hearing_loss_through_smoking'], ['Smoking', 'increases', 'risk_of_hearing_loss'], ['Age', 'causes', 'age_related_hearing_loss'], ['Noise', 'causes', 'noise_induced_hearing_loss'], ['Age_related_hearing_loss', 'caused_by', 'age'], ['Noise_induced_hearing_loss', 'caused_by', 'loud_noise']]","Smoking can increase the likelihood of hearing loss. Research shows that tobacco use can damage the tiny hair cells in the inner ear, leading to hearing loss. By quitting smoking, you can reduce your risk of developing age-related hearing loss and noise-induced hearing loss. Additionally, avoiding secondhand smoke can also help protect your hearing health.",[],"Many adults eventually realize they're pressing the âvolume upâ button on the TV remote more often, or that a lot of people around them need to speak up.. There are two common reasons people start to lose their hearing: Age: As you get older, the tiny hair cells in your inner ears slowly break down and can't pick up sound vibrations as well as they used to.. Noise: A lot of loud sound over time can damage the hair cells in your ears.. The good news?. You can do some things to avoid noise-induced hearing loss and keep age-related hearing loss from getting worse.. Here are eight tips to help keep your ears as sharp as possible.. How loud is too loud?. If you have to shout over the noise around you, it's loud enough to damage your hearing.. Sounds from motorcycles, concert speakers, power tools like saws and drills, earphones, and more are all loud enough to make a difference.. Think about buying appliances and devices that have low noise ratings.. And if it's too loud in the movie theater, restaurant, or any other place you go often, ask the manager to turn it down.. Sometimes you can't avoid the blare of an ambulance siren or the jackhammer on your street corner.. But it's best to limit the amount of time you're around them.. Noise-induced hearing loss is a result of the loudness of sounds and how long you hear them.. If you know you're going to be around loud sounds for more than a few minutes, think about wearing protection, such as: Earplugs.. Usually made of foam or rubber, they go in your ear canal and can reduce noise by 15 to 30 decibels.. You can buy them off-the-shelf or have them custom-made to fit you.. Some earplugs lower noise levels evenly across all frequencies.. They're useful for people who need to make sound quieter but undistorted, such as musicians.. Earmuffs.. These fit completely over your ears and reduce sounds by about 15 to 30 decibels.. They have to fit tightly over both ears to block sound.. You can also wear earplugs and earmuffs together for even greater protection.. Tobacco can make you more likely to lose your hearing, too, research shows.. So if you light up, that's one more good reason to quit.. If you aren't a smoker, avoid breathing secondhand smoke.. A buildup of wax in your ears can muffle sound.. But don't use a cotton swab to clean them out -- they can push wax deeper in.. Instead, use an at-home irrigation kit to soften wax and gently wash it out.. If it gets compacted in your ear, your doctor may need to remove it.. About 200 drugs can damage hearing, including some antibiotics and cancer-fighting drugs.. Even high doses of aspirin can harm your ears.. If you take a prescription medication, check with your doctor to make sure it won't make an impact.. If you must take a medication that may harm your ears, make sure your doctor checks your hearing and balance before and during your treatment.. Make an appointment to get a hearing test if you: Have close relatives with hearing loss Have trouble hearing conversations Are around loud noises on a regular basis Often hear ringing in your ears If you have some hearing loss, you can avoid getting more damage by steering clear of loud noises.. If your problem is severe enough, think about a hearing aid or other treatment.. Be sure to see your doctor if you have a sudden change in what you can hear that you can't explain.. It could be a symptom of other serious medical problems.",[]
67,How does premature ovarian failure cause premature menopause?,"Normally, the ovaries produce both estrogen and progesterone. However, when the ovaries prematurely stop releasing eggs, the levels of these two hormones change.

This leads to a drop in estrogen production and the onset of menopause before the age of 40. Unlike premature menopause, which is not always permanent, premature ovarian failure can be reversible with treatment. However, if the ovaries are surgically removed or damaged by radiation or chemotherapy, it can result in induced menopause. Regardless of the cause, premature menopause can have health risks related to the loss of estrogen, including an increased risk of osteoporosis, heart disease, and poor skin elasticity, among others.","[['premature_ovarian_failure', 'can_lead_to', 'induced_menopause'], ['induced_menopause', 'caused_by', 'surgical_removal_of_ovaries'], ['induced_menopause', 'caused_by', 'damage_to_ovaries'], ['health_risks_of_premature_ovarian_failure', 'include', 'osteoporosis'], ['health_risks_of_premature_ovarian_failure', 'include', 'heart_disease'], ['health_risks_of_premature_ovarian_failure', 'include', 'poor_skin_elasticity']]","Menopause is a normal condition that all women experience as they age.. The term ""menopause"" can describe any of the changes a woman goes through either just before or after she stops menstruating, marking the end of her reproductive period.. A woman is born with a finite number of eggs, which are stored in the ovaries.. The ovaries also make the hormones estrogen and progesterone, which control menstruation and ovulation.. Menopause happens when the ovaries no longer release an egg every month and menstruation stops.. Menopause is considered a normal part of aging when it happens after the age of 40.. But some women can go through menopause early, either as a result of surgery, such as hysterectomy, or damage to the ovaries, such as from chemotherapy.. Menopause that happens before 40, regardless of the cause, is called premature menopause.. Natural menopause is not brought on by any type of medical or surgical treatment.. The process is gradual and has three stages: Perimenopause .. This typically begins several years before menopause, when the ovaries gradually make less estrogen.. Perimenopause lasts up until menopause, the point when the ovaries stop releasing eggs.. In the last 1 to 2 years of perimenopause, the drop in estrogen quickens.. At this stage, many women have menopause symptoms.. Menopause.. This is the point when it's been a year since a woman last had her last menstrual period.. At this stage, the ovaries have stopped releasing eggs and making most of their estrogen.. Postmenopause.. These are the years after menopause.. During this stage, menopausal symptoms such as hot flashes ease for most women.. But health risks related to the loss of estrogen rise as the woman ages.. Premature menopause can be the result of genetics, autoimmune disorders, or medical procedures.. Other conditions that may cause early menopause include: Premature ovarian failure.. Normally, the ovaries make both estrogen and progesterone.. Changes in the levels of these two hormones happen when the ovaries, for unknown reasons, prematurely stop releasing eggs.. When this happens before the age of 40, it's called premature ovarian failure.. Unlike premature menopause, premature ovarian failure is not always permanent.. Induced menopause. "". Induced"" menopause happens when the ovaries are surgically removed for medical reasons, such as uterine cancer or endometriosis.. Induced menopause can also result from damage to the ovaries caused by radiation or chemotherapy.. Most women approaching menopause will have hot flashes, a sudden feeling of warmth that spreads over the upper body, often with blushing and some sweating.. The severity of hot flashes varies from mild in most women to severe in others.. Other common symptoms around the time of menopause include: Irregular or skipped periods Insomnia Mood swings Fatigue Depression Irritability Racing heart Headaches Joint and muscle aches and pains Changes in libido (sex drive) Vaginal dryness Bladder control problems Not all women get all of these symptoms.. Either you'll suspect the approach of menopause on your own, or your doctor will, based on symptoms you've told her about.. To help figure it out, your doctor can do a certain blood test.. It also helps if you keep track of your periods and chart them as they become irregular.. Your menstrual pattern will be an added clue to your doctor about whether you're premenopausal.. The loss of estrogen linked with menopause has been tied to a number of health problems that become more common as women age.. After menopause, women are more likely to have: Osteoporosis Heart disease A poorly working bladder and bowel Greater risk of Alzheimer's disease Poor skin elasticity (increased wrinkling) Poor muscle power and tone Some weakening in vision, such as from cataracts (clouding of the lens of the eye) and macular degeneration (breakdown of the tiny spot in the center of the retina that is the center of vision) A number of treatments can help lower risks that are linked with these conditions.","[['ovaries', 'make_hormones', 'estrogen'], ['ovaries', 'make_hormones', 'progesterone'], ['menopause_symptoms', 'include', 'hot_flashes'], ['menopause_symptoms', 'include', 'irregular_or_skipped_periods'], ['menopause_symptoms', 'include', 'insomnia'], ['menopause_symptoms', 'include', 'mood_swings'], ['menopause_symptoms', 'include', 'fatigue'], ['menopause_symptoms', 'include', 'depression'], ['menopause_symptoms', 'include', 'irritability'], ['menopause_symptoms', 'include', 'racing_heart'], ['menopause_symptoms', 'include', 'headaches'], ['menopause_symptoms', 'include', 'joint_and_muscle_pains'], ['menopause_symptoms', 'include', 'changes_in_libido'], ['menopause_symptoms', 'include', 'vaginal_dryness'], ['menopause_symptoms', 'include', 'bladder_control_problems']]"

Once you figure out your reasons, you can work on making the most of your time.. When you're facing something you don't want to do, it can make you feel tense.. Putting off that dreaded chore is a way to get some short-term relief.. The downside is that you'll still have to tackle your task in the future, which may make you feel guilty or angry -- and cause your stress to rise more.. If the tension's bad enough to keep you from getting things done, you might notice it affects you in other ways, too, like: Trouble sleeping Racing thoughts Lack of energy or trouble focusing Headaches or muscle tension Keep your mood in check with regular exercise, limit alcohol and caffeine (which can make stress worse), and get enough sleep.. Talk to a friend or counselor about what's on your mind, too.. Attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder affects behavior..

Another name for it is squamous cell carcinoma in situ.. â In situâ means the cancer âsits inâ the upper layer and hasn't spread into deeper ones.. It usually affects white adults over age 60.. Men seem to get it more often than women.. Bowen's disease causes reddish, sometimes brown, patches on sun-damaged skin, most often on your legs.. You may also see the patches on your head, neck, palms of your hands, and soles of your feet.. Sometimes they develop around the genitals.. Most people develop only one patch, but you can have several of them.. They usually don't cause any discomfort, but they may be: Flat Larger than a half-inch wide Scaly Crusty Oozing Itchy Sore Patches that appear on the genitals can cause problems.. In that area, Bowen's disease may be called one of the following: Bowenoid papulosis: This affects both men and women and causes lesions in the genital area.. They can last from 2 weeks to several years.. Erythroplasia of Queyrat: This affects the tip of a man's penis.. It may cause ulcers as well as discharge, bleeding, itching, or pain when peeing.. Vulvar intraepithelial neoplasia ( VIN): In women, it may cause velvety, bright red patches that itch or burn.. The itching can become severe.. Bowenoid papulosis is caused by HPV (human papillomavirus), which also can cause genital warts and cervical cancer.. The virus is the most common sexually transmitted infection in the U. S. Sexually active people under 30 are at the highest risk for it, because it's most often passed through skin-to-skin contact.. Scientists aren't sure exactly what causes the other forms of Bowen's disease.. However, long-term sun exposure and aging may increase your odds of getting many skin cancers, including this one.. Poisoning with arsenic also appears to make you more likely to get this early form of skin cancer.. You can't always tell by looking at your skin if you have Bowen's disease.. Many other skin conditions can look the same.. It can be mistaken for harmless disorders -- like rashes or eczema -- as well as life-threatening ones, including melanoma.. Your doctor usually has to take a sample of your skin for testing (biopsy) to confirm it.. Bowen's disease can spread to deeper layers of your skin.. Your doctor (a dermatologist, who specializes in skin care and treatment) probably will recommend something called surgical excision.. She'll gently remove the cancerous area and about a quarter-inch beyond it.. If you have a larger patch, you may need a more detailed procedure called Mohs surgery.. A thin layer of tissue is removed and looked at under a microscope.. If cancer cells are seen in the outside edges of the tissue, another thin layer is removed and studied.. When no cancer cells are found, the surgery is over.. Besides surgery, other treatment options are: Curettage and electrodessication: You're given a shot of anesthetic to numb the area, and your doctor scrapes off the patches with a special tool.. Then she'll use high-frequency electric current to stop the bleeding.. She may repeat the process if there are still cancer cells in deeper tissue.. Fluorouracil: This is medication you put on your skin.. It keeps the abnormal cells from growing and reproducing.. It can cause redness, soreness, or peeling after 1 or 2 weeks, but this usually goes away within a month or two.. Imiquimod: This is also medication you put on your skin.. Doctors don't know exactly how it works against cancer, but when it's used to treat warts, it helps your immune system fight the virus that causes them.. Liquid nitrogen cryosurgery: Your doctor sprays liquid nitrogen onto the affected area to freeze it.. Afterward, the area will peel, blister, or scab over, depending on the amount used.. Laser removal: Your doctor will use light energy (photons) to burn off the area.. Photodynamic (âlightâ) therapy: This uses ultraviolet light rays to heal your skin.. Sometimes you may put medication on your skin to make the cells more sensitive to the light.. Radiation therapy: One type uses very tiny electrically charged particles (electrons) to target and kill cancer cells.. This type of radiation enters only the upper layers of your skin, so deeper tissues and organs are safe.. If you have Bowen's disease, you're at a higher risk for other types of skin cancers, especially if you have a weak immune system from disease or medical treatments.. You should have regular follow-ups and skin checks with your doctor.","[[""Bowen's disease"", 'risk factors', 'long-term sun exposure, aging, arsenic poisoning'], ['HPV', 'causes', 'Bowenoid papulosis'], [""Bowen's disease"", 'follow-ups and skin checks', 'with doctor']]"
72,Are there certain medicines that can help rheumatoid arthritis?,"There are a variety of medicines that can help relieve the symptoms of rheumatoid arthritis. While prescription drugs that slow down the disease are the best approach, over-the-counter medications can also be effective in reducing pain and inflammation.

Common NSAIDs include ibuprofen and naproxen, while prescription NSAIDs include celecoxib, diclofenac, and indomethacin. Steroids, such as prednisone, can also be used for short-term relief of symptoms, but they carry risks of side effects such as weight gain, osteoporosis, and dependency.

It's fine to take over-the-counter acetaminophen when your joints hurt occasionally.. But if you have severe joint damage and constant pain, your doctor may prescribe something stronger.. One option is to take acetaminophen paired with an NSAID.. In rare cases, your doctor might prescribe short courses of opioids.. These drugs have side effects and some serious risks.. You could become constipated, too sleepy, or foggy.. Over time, you might get dependent on or addicted to the drug.. If your pain is only in one small area of your body, your doctor might have you try a drug that goes on your skin.. You may hear him call this a topical medicine.. You rub a small amount of cream or gel over the joint that hurts.. Some of these medications come in patches..

All DOs learn this hands-on technique in medical school.. Many use it in the practice along with -- or, in some cases, instead of -- other treatments, such as medication and surgery.. One of the keys to osteopathic medicine is the idea that tightness and restriction in your nerves and muscles can be caused by or lead to other problems.. So DOs are trained to use their hands to gently move your joints and tissues to correct any restrictions in your range of motion.. OMT is the way that they do that.. If you get OMT, you should expect your DO to use their hands to apply light pressure, resistance, and stretching.. It should not hurt.. The practice includes 40 different techniques, including: Soft tissue: You'll feel stretching and pressure on your muscles.. Muscle energy: In this technique, you move your muscles in a specific direction while the DO counters that movement.. Think push-pull.. Myofascial release: Your DO uses firm but gentle pressure to release tension in the fascia, which is the layer of connective tissue that surrounds your bones, muscles, and organs.. Osteopathic cranial manipulative medicine: Your DO applies soft pressure to your skull to stimulate healing.. DOs often use OMT to relieve pain.. Research shows that people with low back pain who got OMT needed fewer painkillers and days off compared to those who didn't have the treatment.. This technique may also ease migraines.. In one study, people who got OMT needed less medicine, had fewer migraine days, and felt less pain than those who took medication but didn't receive OMT.. OMT can also treat other conditions, such as: Shoulder problems Headaches Neck pain Knee problems Depending on your case, your DO may find that you also need other treatments, such as medicine or surgery..

76,How is pulsatile tinnitus diagnosed?,"Pulsatile tinnitus is diagnosed by a hearing test, checking the ears, and looking at the jaw and eyes for signs of increased pressure in the brain.

During the physical examination, your doctor may use a stethoscope to listen for the whooshing or thumping sound in your ears. If they can hear it, they may refer you to an ear specialist, called an otolaryngologist, for further evaluation. The otolaryngologist may perform additional tests, such as a brainstem auditory evoked response (BAER), electrocochleography, or scans of your brain and blood vessels. Blood tests may also be conducted to check for underlying health conditions that could be causing the pulsatile tinnitus. These tests help identify the underlying cause of the condition, which is essential for developing an effective treatment plan.","[['Pulsatile tinnitus', 'is diagnosed through', 'physical examination'], ['Physical examination', 'includes', 'stethoscope'], ['Doctor', 'uses', 'stethoscope'], ['Pulsatile tinnitus', 'is diagnosed through', 'hearing tests'], ['Hearing tests', 'include', 'BAER'], ['Hearing tests', 'include', 'electrocochleography'], ['Pulsatile tinnitus', 'is diagnosed through', 'imaging studies'], ['Imaging studies', 'include', 'brain scans'], ['Imaging studies', 'include', 'blood vessel scans'], ['Pulsatile tinnitus', 'is diagnosed through', 'blood tests']]","If you have a thumping or whooshing sound in one or both ears that seems to follow a steady beat, you may have this rare form of tinnitus.. Like regular tinnitus, you hear a constant sound that others don't.. But with the pulsatile form of this condition, the noise comes from inside your body.. Your doctor may be able to hear it, too, if she listens with a stethoscope.. It's also called rhythmic, vascular, or pulse-synchronous tinnitus.. You regularly hear a sound with a steady beat that seems in sync with your pulse.. You may hear it in only one ear.. For many people, the sound can be loud and distracting, sometimes even unbearable.. You might notice other symptoms if you also have high pressure in the fluid around your brain, a condition called idiopathic intracranial hypertension: Headaches Dizziness Vision problems Hearing loss If you have it, you may need to lose weight, take medication, or have surgery.. Unlike with regular tinnitus, doctors often can pinpoint a specific health problem behind this type: Irregular blood vessels.. This is a common issue.. When blood flows through damaged or kinked vessels in the brain near or around the ear, it can change pressure and noise.. A narrow or kinked neck artery (the carotid artery) or vein (the jugular vein) also can cause the sound.. High blood pressure .. This can lead to a change in blood flow, and things like stress, alcohol, and caffeine can make the noise more noticeable.. Anemia or an overactive thyroid gland.. These can make your blood flow quickly and loudly.. Atherosclerosis .. This is a hardening of your arteries.. As cholesterol and other fats clog your blood vessels, they grow less flexible.. That makes blood flowing near your middle and inner ear move with more force, like water through a narrowed streambed.. You'll usually hear it in both ears.. Head and neck tumors.. These can press on blood vessels and make noise.. Connection problems between arteries and veins.. This condition, called arteriovenous malformation, generally affects only one ear.. You may need to see an ear specialist called an otolaryngologist.. You'll have a hearing test, and the doctor will check your ears.. She may also look at your jaw and check your eyes for signs of increased pressure in your brain.. Other tests might include: Brainstem auditory evoked response ( BAER), which times electrical waves from your brain in response to clicks in your ear Electrocochleography, which is similar to BAER but uses an electrode placed on or in your eardrum Scans of your brain and blood vessels, such as an MRI or CT scan Blood tests This kind of tinnitus is often the first clue that you have something else going on that needs to be treated.. Your treatment plan will depend on what's causing your tinnitus.. You may need medication or surgery repair a blood vessel.. Once the condition that caused it is treated, the sound should stop.. If you're still hearing the noise or your doctor can't find a cause, you can try: White noise.. It can help make the sound less noticeable, especially at bedtime.. You can get a special machine that makes it, or see if an air conditioner or fan in your bedroom helps.. Some smartphone apps make white noise, too.. Wearable sound generators.. These masking devices look like hearing aids.. They create a constant, low-level background noise.. Tinnitus retraining.. You wear a device that plays music in a frequency that helps you tune out the tinnitus..

77,Can drinking alcohol make my cold worse?,"Drinking alcohol can worsen cold symptoms by dehydrating the body and suppressing the immune system.

All that sneezing and coughing is misery enough.. Don't make one of these common mistakes that can make your cold even worse.. It never works.. You can't ignore a cold.. When you get sick, you have to take care of yourself.. Your body needs extra energy when it fights an infection.. If you try to push through a cold, especially if you have a fever, you'll exhaust yourself.. That could make your symptoms worse.. Getting enough shut-eye is key for a healthy immune system, your body's defense against germs.. One study shows that sleeping less than 7 hours a night almost triples your risk of catching a cold in the first place.. If you have a cold and your symptoms are keeping you up at night, go to bed earlier or take naps during the day.. You need extra rest, however you get it.. It can make you more likely to get a cold.. Over time, high levels of stress hormones can stop your immune system from working normally.. The result: more sick days.. You need a lot of fluids when you're sick.. They help thin your mucus, which makes your sinuses drain better.. Just about any liquid will help.. Water, juice, hot tea, and soup are all good.. Even milk is OK, despite what you may have heard.. The idea that it causes mucus buildup is a myth.. Too much of it leaves you dehydrated and makes symptoms like congestion worse.. Alcohol puts a damper on your immune system.. And it might mix badly with cold medications you're taking.. So until you feel better, it's best to lay off the booze.. They may work well at first.. But if you use them for more than 3 days, your stuffy nose will get worse when you stop.. Smoking is bad for your lungs, even when you are not sick.. Still, smokers get more colds than non-smokers..

78,Why is it important to drink liquids when you're sick?,"There are several reasons why it is important to drink liquids when you are sick. A sore throat can make it difficult to swallow, and a fever can cause dehydration. Additionally, your body loses fluid as it produces mucus. Over-the-counter cold medicine can also dry out your head and throat. Drinking plenty of fluids helps to replace the lost fluid and can also help to loosen mucus. However, it is important to avoid alcoholic beverages, coffee, and caffeine, as these can actually worsen dehydration.","[['Person(Dr. Emily Carter)', 'discovers', 'Entity(novel biomarker_for_early_detection_of_sickness)'], ['Entity(body)', 'produces', 'Entity(mucus)'], ['Entity(over_the_counter_cold_medicine)', 'dries_out', 'Entity(head_and_throat)'], ['Entity(water)', 'juice', 'soup'], ['Entity(alcoholic_beverages)', 'coffee', 'caffeine']]","When you're sick, it's easy to get dehydrated due to a sore throat, a fever, or the body making mucus. Drinking plenty of water, juice, or soup helps prevent dehydration, loosens up mucus, and keeps the body hydrated. This is essential for the immune system to function optimally and fight off the virus causing the cold.","[['Person(Dr. Emily Carter)', 'discovers', 'Entity(novel_biomarker_for_early_detection_of_sickness)'], ['Entity(alcoholic_beverages)', 'coffee', 'caffeine'], ['Entity(water)', 'juice', 'soup'], ['Entity(alcoholic_beverages)', 'coffee', 'caffeine']]","var s_context; s_context= s_context || {}; s_context['wb.modimp'] = 'vidfloat'; if(webmd.useragent && webmd.useragent.ua.type === 'desktop'){ webmd.ads2.disable Initial Load(); webmd.ads2.disable Ads Init = true; $(function() { webmd.p.pim.increment(); $('.responsive-video-container').insert After('.module-social-share-container'); require(['video2/1/responsive-player/video-loader'], function(video Loader) { video Loader.init({ autoplay: webmd.useragent.ua.type === 'desktop' && !. !s_sensitive, chron ID: $('article embeded_module[type=video][align=top]:eq(0)').attr('chronic_id'), continuous Play: true, cp Options: { flyout: true }, display Ads: true, mode: 'in-article', sticky: true }) }); }); } else { $(function(){ $('.responsive-video-container').remove(); }); } In today's fast-paced world, it's hard to slow down for a mere case of the sniffles.. Sure, you can try to work through it and hope you'll feel better quickly.. And sometimes that happens.. But more often, those pesky symptoms stick around and leave you feeling sneezy and sniffly.. Colds usually last 3 to 7 days, but sometimes they hang on as long as 2 weeks.. If you're under the weather for longer than that, one of these things could be to blame.. Sleep helps keep your immune system working like it should.. Once you have a cold, you need to catch enough Zzz's to help your body fight off the virus.. Take it extra easy during the first 3 days.. Too little shut-eye can also make you more likely to get a cold.. One study found that people who got less than 7 hours of sleep a night were nearly three times more likely to get sick than people who slept for 8 hours or more.. When you're sick, it's easy to get dehydrated.. A sore throat can make it less than fun to swallow.. A fever draws moisture out of your body.. Plus, you lose fluid as your body makes mucus and it drains away.. And that over-the-counter cold medicine you're taking to dry up your head?. It can dry the rest of you out, too.. So drink plenty of water, juice, or soup.. A side benefit: All that liquid helps loosen up the mucus in your nose and head.. Stay away from booze, coffee, and caffeine when you're looking for things to sip though.. They pull out more liquid than they leave behind.. When you're freaked out about life, work, or whatever, it takes a toll on your immune system.. You can't fight off viruses as well as you should.. That makes you more likely to get a cold, and once that happens, your symptoms are going to be worse.. Ongoing stress makes your body less able to respond to cortisol, a hormone that controls your body's response to threats like the virus that causes the common cold.. It's easy to confuse a cold with other ailments.. You might treat a supposed cold for a few weeks, only to realize that the reason you aren't getting better is because you're under the weather with something else, like allergies.. Here's how to tell them apart: Cold symptoms usually take a few days to fully show up.. Allergies can come on quickly, and they last for as long as you come in contact with the allergen.. Both cause a cough, runny nose, and sneezing, but a cold is more likely to give you aches and pains or a fever.. Or you could have a sinus infection.. Both that and a cold cause pain around your eyes and nose, as well as icky, yellowish mucus.. The difference: These symptoms usually happen within the first few days of a cold.. But a sinus infection typically shows up after the normal time it takes for a cold to run its course.. We've all heard about some of the more popular herbal remedies: Drink this and you'll never get sick again.. Take that and your cold symptoms will be shortened by 3 days.. Many of these claims don't hold water, and it's important to remember that just because the bottle says ""herbal"" doesn't mean it can't harm you.. Echinacea is one of the first natural treatments people suggest when you have a cold, but most studies show it just doesn't work.. Many people down vitamin C like candy thinking it'll speed up the cold process.. But there's little evidence that it helps shorten a cold once you have it.. And the only folks it really seems to work for are extreme athletes who take it to prevent getting a cold.. Zinc also gets called out for helping end your cold, but again the evidence is weak.. And some people who used a nasal spray with zinc lost their sense of smell.. So your best bet is to leave it on the shelf.. It isn't just natural treatments that don't work for colds.. Antibiotics won't help either, because a virus causes these illnesses.. The best way to treat your cold is to manage the symptoms.. Save the antibiotics for strep throat or a sinus infection.. It's OK to be active if your cold symptoms are all above your neck, like a runny nose, stuffy head, sneezing or sore throat.. Consider ramping down from a run to a walk, though.. But if you have symptoms below the neck, like chest congestion, a hacking cough, an upset tummy, fever, muscle aches or fatigue, give yourself permission to sit it out.. Rest is what gives your immune system time to recharge.","[['Person(Dr. Emily Carter)', 'discovers', 'Entity(novel_biomarker_for_early_detection_of_sickness)'], ['Entity(alcoholic_beverages)', 'coffee', 'caffeine'], ['Entity(water)', 'juice', 'soup'], ['Entity(alcoholic_beverages)', 'coffee', 'caffeine']]"

There's no reason to panic -- more than a third of your fellow Americans have the same problem.. But too much of the fat-like substance can build up in your arteries.. It can slow your blood flow, raise the likelihood of dangerous blood clots, and put you at greater risk for heart disease, heart attack, and stroke.. Yes, there are medications that can help you bring your levels to a healthier range.. But even if your doctor prescribes one for you, you still need to make some adjustments in your everyday life to get your cholesterol under control.. So where do you start?. The first thing you need to do to improve your health is to change what you put into your body.. You can lower your cholesterol by swapping out certain foods for healthier choices.. Start by loading your plate with plant-based foods like fruits, vegetables, whole grains, and beans.. Not only are they low in cholesterol, they're high in fiber.. That'll keep things moving through your digestive tract.. Fish, nuts, low-fat dairy, and lean poultry are good choices, too.. Saturated fat and trans fats raise the level of cholesterol in your blood.. You find them in meat, skin-on poultry, full-fat dairy products, and in many processed foods.. To make sure you don't get too much of them, check out the Nutrition Facts label on a food's package.. Along with the listed amounts of saturated and trans fats, look at the list of ingredients.. If it says âpartially hydrogenated oil,â the food has trans fats.. A balanced diet also will help you manage your weight, which is another part of your risk for heart disease.. Keep in mind that âfatâ and âcholesterolâ are not always bad words.. Monounsaturated and polyunsaturated fats found in fish and nuts help reduce LDL, the so-called âbad cholesterol,â in your blood.. Some of these foods also boost HDL, the âgood cholesterol,â which flows through your bloodstream and removes LDL.. Want to maximize the effects of your new, low-cholesterol diet?. Get moving.. Physical activity doesn't have much direct effect on your LDL levels, but it does raise HDL as it lowers the amount of fat in your blood called triglycerides.. Exercise also helps you keep off extra pounds and lowers your blood pressure -- two other contributors to heart disease.. You should try to get a total of 30 minutes of heart-pumping exercise almost every day, like walking, running, swimming, biking, or hitting the elliptical or step machine.. If you've been inactive for a long time, you'll want to start off slow, walking for a few minutes at a time.. Talk to your doctor about what kinds and how much exercise is right for you.. Your cholesterol levels are yet another reason to stop smoking.. The carbon monoxide you inhale from cigarettes increases the level of cholesterol that builds up along the walls of your arteries..

It's a lot to take in.. But there are steps that can help.. These include working with their doctor to treat their dementia symptoms and any other conditions they may have.. There are also other kinds of therapies that may help with their daily life.. And everyday habits also matter, such as exercise, good nutrition, staying social, doing things that challenge their mind, and getting good sleep.. No medication can cure dementia.. But some may help with some of the symptoms for a time.. And doctors may prescribe other meds to treat problems brought on by dementia, such as depression, trouble sleeping, or irritability.. Cholinesterase inhibitors such as donepezil ( Aricept), galantamine ( Razadyne), and rivastigmine ( Exelon) slow the breakdown of a brain chemical involved in memory and judgment.. Memantine ( Namenda) helps control a different brain chemical needed for learning and memory.. Sometimes doctors prescribe memantine along with donepezil in a combination drug ( Namzaric) for moderate to severe dementia.. Antidepressants , especially selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors ( SSRIs), can improve low mood and irritability.. Anxiolytics such as lorazepam ( Ativan) or oxazepam ( Serax) can ease anxiety or restlessness.. Antipsychotic medicines such as aripiprazole ( Abilify), haloperidol ( Haldol), olanzapine ( Zyprexa), and risperidone ( Risperdal) can help control feelings and behaviors such as aggression, agitation, delusions, or hallucinations.. These approaches might help jog your loved one's memory and thinking skills -- or at least give them pleasure and brighten their day.. Make sure anything they try helps their quality of life and doesn't make them feel frustrated or overwhelmed.. Reminiscence therapy might include things like talking with your loved one about their hometown, school days, work life, or favorite hobbies.. It can be done one-on-one or in groups as part of an organized therapy.. The person leading the session might use music from your loved one's past, or things like photos or treasured items, to help.. Cognitive stimulation therapy ( CST) is a structured program for groups of people with mild to moderate dementia.. At meetings, the group does mentally engaging activities, like talking about current events, singing, playing word games, or cooking from a recipe.. Reality orientation training goes over basic things like the person's name, and the date and time.. They might have signs with that information placed around their home.. Some people find this to be too much or even patronizing.. If it's not working for your loved one, drop it.. Even when someone has dementia, their daily habits can affect how they feel.. The same things that are good for their heart and the rest of their body are also going to help their mind -- and their mood.. Stay active.. Whether it's a fitness class for seniors or other physical activity such as walking, dancing, and gardening, it counts.. Of course, you'll want to make sure their workouts are safe for them to do, and their abilities might be different depending on whether they are in the early, middle, or later stages of dementia (and what other conditions they may have).. Research shows that exercise may slow down dementia symptoms such as thinking problems, and ease anxiety or depression.. Prioritize good sleep.. For many people with dementia, symptoms can be worse later in the day.. So encourage a calm routine.. It helps for your loved one to avoid caffeinated tea and coffee, especially in the evening, and to limit daytime naps.. Keep the end of the day quiet, without a blaring TV.. Focus on foods.. What your loved one eats will affect their health, including their brain.. Good habits may even have the power to slow dementia.. You may have heard of the MIND diet.. It combines the traditional Mediterranean diet and the DASH diet (which seeks to lower high blood pressure).. It's being studied as a way to cut the chance of getting dementia.. More research is being done to check on that, and whether it curbs dementia that's already started.. But in general, it's a healthy way of eating that's in line with communities where dementia tends to be rare.. Researchers say the MIND diet includes: Vegetables, especially leafy greens (think of spinach, kale, and other greens) Nuts Berries Beans Whole grains Fish Poultry Olive oil Wine The plan limits red meat, butter and stick margarine, cheese, sweets, and fried foods.. Keep in mind that eating isn't just about nutrients and calories.. It's also social and personal, and a source of enjoyment.. If your loved one is able to cook, let them join in.. And make sure they are involved in what they eat.. Challenge the brain.. This doesn't have to include doing crossword puzzles or sudoku, unless your loved one enjoys those things and can still do them without getting frustrated.. Instead, it might mean revisiting a hobby that person has always loved and is still able to do, like enjoying music, playing the piano, or going to services if they had a longtime place of worship.. If these things help them stay social, that's even better.. Stay organized.. Keep a calendar and other easy-to-see reminders around their home to help remember upcoming events and plans.. Rethink the home.. You may want to remove items that create clutter and noise (such as extra TVs or radios) and hide things that can be dangerous, such as knives or car keys.. Seeing and hearing properly are especially important for someone with dementia.. Trouble seeing can make it harder to recognize familiar people or things.. Vision or hearing problems can also make dementia symptoms like confusion worse as well as make your loved one feel more alone.. Schedule a vision checkup with your loved one's eye doctor to see if they need a new eyeglass prescription.. Also, ask their primary doctor to refer you to a doctor who can do a hearing test to give them a new hearing aid, if needed.. A dementia diagnosis is stressful.. If your loved one needs help coming to terms with it, ask the doctor treating their dementia to refer you to a trained mental health professional.. ( You might also want to do this for yourself, if you'd like help adjusting to their condition.). This might include an individual or family therapist, social worker, psychologist, or psychiatrist.. Joining a local or online support group for people with dementia can also be comforting.. At your loved one's first visit with a counselor, they'll talk about their symptoms (emotional, mental, and physical) and why they want counseling.. You might take a survey with these questions.. Your answers will give the counselor a better idea of the best ways to help.","[['loved one', 'symptoms', 'memory, thinking skills, mood, and behavior'], ['doctor', 'treats', 'dementia symptoms'], ['exercise', 'benefits', 'memory, thinking skills, mood, and behavior']]"

This empowers them to understand what is expected of them and helps reduce the anxiety that can come with unexpected changes. By setting clear rules, routines, and consequences, parents can create an environment where their teen feels secure and able to focus on their behavior and growth. Additionally, teens are influenced by the adults in their lives, so setting a good example and being consistent with expectations and responses can have a positive impact on their behavior and self-esteem.","[['Predictability', 'helps_teens_with_ADHD', 'provide_structure']]","Whether your child with ADHD is young or a teen, you can show them you're firm but fair (and fun) by doing two key things.. Encourage good behavior with praise or rewards immediately.. Make consequences for bad behavior clear, understood, and consistent.. Your approach will depend on your child's age.. Organize the day.. Have a routine.. Let your child know if it's changing or if something unusual is going to happen, like a visit from a relative or a vacation.. Set rules and expectations.. It's best to do this right before an activity or situation.. Use rewards.. If your child does something you're proud of, give him a gold star, or give him time for his favorite hobby.. Try not to use money, food, or candy for rewards.. Engage your child with mind-building activities, such as reading, games, and puzzles.. Join in!. Use a timer.. Some parents find this helps build structure.. For example, set a reasonable time limit for a bath or playtime.. It helps train your child to expect limitations, even on fun things.. Give your child a time limit for doing a chore, too, especially if you reward her for finishing on time.. Explain and instruct.. Give clear instructions for tasks.. If a chore is hard or lengthy, break it down into steps that can be done one at a time.. Reward your child for good behavior and tasks completed.. Have a clear system for incentives (like a point system or gold stars) so your child knows what to expect when they finish a chore or behave better.. Be consistent with your expectations, and always follow through with rewards.. Make a plan for discipline.. Set up a specific consequence for a certain misbehavior.. Be consistent and fair about enforcing it.. Try not to discipline your child in front of others.. Talk regularly with your child's teachers, so you can deal with any behavior concerns before they become a major problem.. Walk your talk.. Set a good example for your child.. Children with ADHD need role models for good behavior.. Involve them.. As your child matures, let them help set expectations, rewards, and consequences.. This empowers them, which may improve their self-esteem and reinforce the idea that they're in charge of their own behavior.. This will also help them become more responsible as they move toward young adulthood.. Discipline in private.. Teenagers are often sensitive of how they appear to others.. So they may overreact or feel ashamed if you discipline them in public.. The teen years can be tough for any kid, so be gentle and understanding.. Talk with them about any issues they're having.. Talk with your teen's teachers when issues in the classroom come up.. Talk with your child, too.. Make a plan to deal with it, together.. Be predictable.. Be consistent and fair with how you act.. That way, your teen knows what to expect from you.. Set a good example.. Teens don't always show it, but the adults in their lives are very influential and important to them.. All parents find themselves frustrated at times, and raising a child with ADHD has its own set of challenges.. It's natural to have needs and questions.. When you're feeling overwhelmed, talk to someone about it.. Look for a support group, or see a mental health professional to help you deal with your emotions and reactions so you can be a more effective parent..

You might feel pain in the back of your head or the base of your skull.. People can confuse it with a migraine or other types of headache, because the symptoms can be similar.. But treatments for those conditions are very different, so it's important to see your doctor to get the right diagnosis.. Occipital neuralgia can cause intense pain that feels like a sharp, jabbing, electric shock in the back of the head and neck.. Other symptoms include: Aching, burning, and throbbing pain that typically starts at the base of the head and goes to the scalp Pain on one or both sides of the head Pain behind the eye Sensitivity to light Tender scalp Pain when you move your neck Occipital neuralgia happens when there's pressure or irritation to your occipital nerves, maybe because of an injury, tight muscles that entrap the nerves, or inflammation.. Many times, doctors can't find a cause for it.. Some medical conditions are linked to it, including: Trauma to the back of the head Neck tension or tight neck muscles Osteoarthritis Tumors in the neck Cervical disc disease Infection Gout Diabetes Blood vessel inflammation Your doctor will ask you questions about your medical history and about any injuries you've had.. She'll do a physical exam, too.. She'll press firmly around the back of your head to see if she can reproduce your pain.. She may also give you a shot to numb the nerve, called a nerve block, to see if it gives you relief.. If it works, occipital neuralgia is likely the cause of the pain.. You might also have blood tests or an MRI scan if your doctor thinks your case isn't typical.. You have to get the right diagnosis to get the right treatment.. For example, if you have occipital neuralgia and you get a prescription for migraine medication, you may not get relief.. The first thing you'll want to do is to relieve your pain.. You can try to: Apply heat to your neck.. Rest in a quiet room.. Massage tight and painful neck muscles.. Take over-the-counter anti-inflammatory drugs, like naproxen or ibuprofen..

These shells are bonded to the front of the teeth changing their color, shape, size, or length.. Embed Asset Override Dental veneers can be made from porcelain or from resin composite materials.. Porcelain veneers resist stains better than resin veneers and better mimic the light reflecting properties of natural teeth.. You will need to discuss the best choice of veneer material for you with your dentist.. Veneers are routinely used to fix: Teeth that are discolored -- either because of root canal treatment; stains from tetracycline or other drugs, excessive fluoride or other causes; or the presence of large resin fillings that have discolored the tooth Teeth that are worn down Teeth that are chipped or broken Teeth that are misaligned, uneven, or irregularly shaped (for example, have craters or bulges in them) Teeth with gaps between them (to close the space between these teeth) Getting a dental veneer usually requires three trips to the dentist â one for a consultation and two to make and apply the veneers.. One tooth or many teeth can simultaneously undergo the veneering process described below.. Embed Asset Override Diagnosis and treatment planning.. This first step involves your active participation.. Explain to your dentist the result that you are trying to achieve.. During this appointment, your dentist will examine your teeth to make sure dental veneers are appropriate for you and discuss what the procedure will involve and some of its limitations.. He or she also may take X-rays and possibly make impressions of your mouth and teeth.. Preparation.. To prepare a tooth for a veneer, your dentist will reshape the tooth surface, which is an amount nearly equal to the thickness of the veneer to be added to the tooth surface.. Before trimming off the enamel, you and your dentist will decide the need for a local anesthetic to numb the area.. Next, your dentist will make a model or impression of your tooth.. This model is sent out to a dental laboratory, which in turn constructs your veneer.. It usually takes 2-4 weeks for your dentist to receive the veneers back from the laboratory.. Temporary dental veneers can be used for very unsightly teeth.. Bonding .. Before the dental veneer is permanently cemented to your tooth, your dentist will temporarily place it on your tooth to examine its fit and color.. He or she will repeatedly remove and trim the veneer as needed to achieve the proper fit; the veneer color can be adjusted with the shade of cement to be used.. Next, to prepare your tooth to receive the veneer, your tooth will be cleaned, polished, and etched -- which roughens the tooth to allow for a strong bonding process.. A special cement is applied to the veneer and the veneer is then placed on your tooth.. Once properly position on the tooth, your dentist will apply a special light beam to the dental veneer, which activates chemicals in the cement, causing it to harden or cure very quickly.. The final steps involve removing any excess cement, evaluating your bite and making any final adjustments in the veneer as necessary.. Your dentist may ask you to return for a follow-up visit in a couple of weeks to check how your gums are responding to the presence of your veneer and to once again examine the veneer's placement.. Veneers offer the following advantages: They provide a natural tooth appearance.. Gum tissue tolerates porcelain well.. Porcelain veneers are stain resistant.. The color of a porcelain veneer can be selected such that it makes dark teeth appear whiter.. Veneers offer a conservative approach to changing a tooth's color and shape; veneers generally don't require the extensive shaping prior to the procedure that crowns do, yet offer a stronger, more aesthetic alternative.. The downside to dental veneers include: The process is not reversible.. Veneers are more costly than composite resin bonding.. Veneers are usually not repairable should they chip or crack.. Because enamel has been removed, your tooth may become more sensitive to hot and cold foods and beverages.. Veneers may not exactly match the color of your other teeth.. Also, the veneer's color cannot be altered once in place.. If you plan on whitening your teeth, you need to do so before getting veneers.. Though not likely, veneers can dislodge and fall off.. To minimize the chance of this occurring, do not bite your nails; chew on pencils, ice, or other hard objects; or otherwise put excessive pressure on your teeth.. Teeth with veneers can still experience decay, possibly necessitating full coverage of the tooth with a crown.. Veneers are not a good choice for individuals with unhealthy teeth (for example, those with decay or active gum disease), weakened teeth (as a result of decay, fracture, large dental fillings), or for those who have an inadequate amount of existing enamel on the tooth surface.. Individuals who clench and grind their teeth are poor candidates for porcelain veneers, as these activities can cause the veneers to crack or chip.. Veneers generally last between 7 and 15 years.. After this time, the veneers would need to be replaced.. Dental veneers do not require any special care.. Continue to follow good oral hygiene practices, including brushing, flossing, and rinsing with an antiseptic mouthwash as you normally would.. Embed Asset Override Even though porcelain veneers resist stains, your dentist may recommend that you avoid stain-causing foods and beverages (for example, coffee, tea, or red wine).. Yes, alternatives to veneers include bondings and crowns.. Veneers offer a nice intermediate option.. Veneers may be best suited for individuals who want to change the shape of their teeth more than just a little bit -- as is done with bonding -- but not enough to require a crown.. Costs of veneers vary depending on what part of the country you live in and on the extent of your procedure.. Generally, veneers range in cost from $1,000 to $2,000 per tooth.. The cost of veneers is not generally covered by insurance.. To be certain, check with your specific dental insurance company..

Antidepressant drug therapy and/or psychotherapy may be necessary.. Unfortunately, difficulty with concentration and minor memory problems can often be a normal part of perimenopause, the time leading up to menopause (defined as not having a period for a year).. The good news is that it is likely to be temporary.. Current medical knowledge is limited as to why memory changes occur with perimenopause, and there are currently no treatments available to relieve these symptoms.. If you are having memory problems, discuss this with your doctor..

Caregivers may feel guilty for taking time for themselves, leading to neglect of their own emotional, physical, and spiritual health. Unclear boundaries between their caregiving role and other relationships can also contribute to burnout. Additionally, caring for a loved one with a progressive disease or disorder can lead to feelings of helplessness and frustration, and the lack of resources or skills to effectively manage care can further exacerbate burnout. It is essential for caregivers to recognize the signs of burnout and take steps to prevent it, such as seeking support from trusted individuals, setting realistic goals, taking time for self-care, and utilizing available resources like respite care services and support groups.","[['caregiver burnout', 'characterized_by', 'physical_exhaustion'], ['caregiver burnout', 'characterized_by', 'emotional_exhaustion'], ['caregiver burnout', 'characterized_by', 'mental_exhaustion'], ['caregiver burnout', 'accompanied_by', 'change_in_attitude'], ['caregiver burnout', 'symptoms', 'withdrawal_from_friends_and_family'], ['caregiver burnout', 'symptoms', 'loss_of_interest_in_activities'], ['caregiver burnout', 'symptoms', 'feeling_blue_irritable_hopeless_and_helpless'], ['caregiver burnout', 'symptoms', 'changes_in_appetite_weight'], ['caregiver burnout', 'symptoms', 'changes_in_sleep_patterns'], ['caregiver burnout', 'symptoms', 'getting_sick_more_often'], ['caregiver burnout', 'symptoms', 'feelings_of_wanting_to_hurt_yourself_or_the_person_for_whom_you_are_caring'], ['caregiver burnout', 'symptoms', 'emotional_and_physical_exhaustion'], ['caregiver burnout', 'symptoms', 'excessive_use_of_alcohol_and_sleep_medications'], ['caregiver burnout', 'symptoms', 'irritability'], ['caregiver burnout', 'risk_factors', 'lack_of_help'], ['caregiver burnout', 'risk_factors', 'trying_to_do_more_than_able'], ['caregiver burnout', 'risk_factors', 'feeling_guilty_for_taking_time_for_oneself'], ['caregiver burnout', 'risk_factors', 'unclear_boundaries_between_caregiving_role_and_other_relationships'], ['caregiver burnout', 'risk_factors', 'caring_for_a_loved_one_with_a_progressive_disease_or_disorder'], ['caregiver burnout', 'risk_factors', 'lack_of_resources_or_skills_to_effectively_manage_care'], ['caregiver burnout', 'risk_factors', 'unreasonable_burdens_upon_oneself']]","Caregiver burnout is a state of physical, emotional, and mental exhaustion that may be accompanied by a change in attitude -- from positive and caring to negative and unconcerned.. Burnout can occur when caregivers don't get the help they need, or if they try to do more than they are able -- either physically or financially.. Caregivers who are ""burned out"" may experience fatigue, stress, anxiety, and depression.. Many caregivers also feel guilty if they spend time on themselves rather than on their ill or elderly loved ones.. The symptoms of caregiver burnout are similar to the symptoms of stress and depression.. They may include: Withdrawal from friends and family Loss of interest in activities previously enjoyed Feeling blue, irritable, hopeless, and helpless Changes in appetite, weight, or both Changes in sleep patterns Getting sick more often Feelings of wanting to hurt yourself or the person for whom you are caring Emotional and physical exhaustion Excessive use of alcohol and/or sleep medications Irritability Call 911 or the National Suicide Prevention Lifeline at 1-800-273-8255 if you think you might hurt yourself or anyone else.. Caregivers often are so busy caring for others that they tend to neglect their own emotional, physical, and spiritual health.. The demands on a caregiver's body, mind, and emotions can easily seem overwhelming, leading to fatigue and hopelessness -- and, ultimately, burnout.. Other factors that can lead to caregiver burnout include: Role confusion -- Many people are confused when thrust into the role of caregiver.. It can be difficult for a person to separate her role as caregiver from her role as spouse, lover, child, friend, etc.. Unrealistic expectations -- Many caregivers expect their involvement to have a positive effect on the health and happiness of the patient.. This may be unrealistic for patients suffering from a progressive disease, such as Parkinson's or Alzheimer's.. Lack of control -- Many caregivers become frustrated by a lack of money, resources, and skills to effectively plan, manage, and organize their loved one's care.. Unreasonable demands -- Some caregivers place unreasonable burdens upon themselves, in part because they see providing care as their exclusive responsibility.. Other factors -- Many caregivers cannot recognize when they are suffering burnout and eventually get to the point where they cannot function effectively.. They may even become sick themselves.. Here are some steps you can take to help prevent caregiver burnout: Find someone you trust -- such as a friend, co-worker, or neighbor -- to talk to about your feelings and frustrations.. Set realistic goals, accept that you may need help with caregiving, and turn to others for help with some tasks.. Be realistic about your loved one's disease, especially if it is a progressive disease such as Parkinson's or Alzheimer's.. Don't forget about yourself because you're too busy caring for someone else.. Set aside time for yourself, even if it's just an hour or two.. Remember, taking care of yourself is not a luxury; it is an absolute necessity if you're going to be an effective caregiver.. Talk to a professional.. Most therapists, social workers, and clergy members are trained to counsel individuals dealing with a wide range of physical and emotional issues.. Take advantage of respite care services.. Respite care provides a temporary break for caregivers.. This can range from a few hours of in-home care to a short stay in a nursing home or assisted living facility.. Know your limits and do a reality check of your personal situation.. Recognize and accept your potential for caregiver burnout.. Educate yourself.. The more you know about the illness, the more effective you will be in caring for the person with the illness.. Develop new tools for coping.. Remember to lighten up and accentuate the positive.. Use humor to help deal with everyday stresses.. Stay healthy by eating right and getting plenty of exercise and sleep.. Accept your feelings.. Having negative feelings -- such as frustration or anger -- about your responsibilities or the person for whom you are caring is normal.. It does not mean you are a bad person or a bad caregiver.. If you are already suffering from stress and depression, seek medical attention.. Stress and depression are treatable disorders.. If you want to help prevent burnout, consider turning to the following resources for help with your caregiving: Home health services -- These agencies provide home health aids and nurses for short-term care, if your loved one is acutely ill.. Some agencies provide short-term respite care.. Adult day care-- These programs offer a place for seniors to socialize, engage in a variety of activities, and receive needed medical care and other services.. Nursing homes or assisted living facilities -- These institutions sometimes offer short-term respite stays to provide caregivers a break from their caregiving responsibilities.. Private care aides -- These are professionals who specialize in assessing current needs and coordinating care and services.. Caregiver support services -- These include support groups and other programs that can help caregivers recharge their batteries, meet others coping with similar issues, find more information, and locate additional resources.. Area Agency on Aging -- Contact your local Area Agency on Aging or your local chapter of the AARP for services available in your area such as adult day care services, caregiver support groups, and respite care.. National organizations -- Look in a phone directory or search online for local agencies (such as Family Caregiver Alliance), chapters of national organizations dedicated to assisting people with illnesses such as Parkinson's disease or stroke.. These groups can provide resources and information about respite care and support groups.","[['caregiver burnout', 'prevention', 'finding_someone_you_trust'], ['caregiver burnout', 'prevention', 'setting_realistic_goals'], ['caregiver burnout', 'prevention', 'accepting_help_with_caregiving'], ['caregiver burnout', 'prevention', 'being_realistic_about_loved_ones_disease'], ['caregiver burnout', 'prevention', 'setting_aside_time_for_oneself'], ['caregiver burnout', 'prevention', 'talking_to_a_professional'], ['caregiver burnout', 'prevention', 'utilizing_respite_care_services'], ['caregiver burnout', 'prevention', 'educating_oneself'], ['caregiver burnout', 'prevention', 'developing_new_tools_for_coping'], ['caregiver burnout', 'prevention', 'remembering_to_lighten_up_and_accentuate_the_positive'], ['caregiver burnout', 'prevention', 'staying_healthy'], ['caregiver burnout', 'prevention', 'accepting_feelings'], ['caregiver burnout', 'prevention', 'seeking_medical_attention_for_stress_and_depression'], ['caregiver burnout', 'prevention', 'turning_to_resources_for_help']]"

It's called a pilonidal cyst, and it can become infected and filled with pus.. Once infected, the technical term is âpilonidal abscess,â and it can be painful.. It looks like a large pimple at the bottom of your tailbone.. It is more common in men than in women.. It usually happens more often in younger people.. People who sit a lot, such as truck drivers, have a higher chance of getting one.. They can be treated.. If your cyst becomes a problem, your doctor can drain it or take it out through surgery.. Most doctors think that ingrown hairs are the reason for many of them.. Pilonidal means ""nest of hair,"" and doctors sometimes find hair follicles inside the cyst.. Another theory is that pilonidal cysts appear after a trauma to that region of your body.. During World War II, more than 80,000 soldiers got pilonidal cysts that put them in the hospital.. People thought they were because of irritation from riding in bumpy Jeeps.. For a while, the condition was called "" Jeep disease."". You might be more likely to get one if you were born with a small dimple in the skin between your buttocks.. This dimple can tend to get infected, though doctors aren't exactly sure why..

The symptoms of a pilonidal cyst include: Pain, redness, and swelling at the bottom of the spine Pus or blood draining out of it Bad smell from the pus Tenderness to the touch Fever They can vary in size.. Yours may be a small dimple or cover a large, painful area.. A pilonidal cyst is an abscess or boil.. Treatment may include antibiotics, hot compresses and topical treatment with depilatory creams.. In more severe cases it needs to be drained, or lanced, to heal.. Like other boils, it does not get better with antibiotics.. If you have any of the symptoms, call your doctor.. Your doctor can diagnose a pilonidal cyst with a physical exam and by asking you questions about it.. Among the things he may ask you: When did you first feel symptoms?. Have you had this problem before?. Have you had a fever?. What medications or supplements do you take?. Early in the infection of a pilonidal cyst, the redness, swelling, and pain may not be too bad.. Some things you might want to try: To ease any pain, soak in a tub of warm water.. Sometimes, your cyst may open and drain on its own this way.. Take nonprescription pain medicine, but follow the dosing instructions.. Keep the cyst and area around it clean and dry.. Antibiotics do not heal a pilonidal cyst.. But doctors have any number of procedures they can try.. Here are some options: Incision and drainage: This is the preferred method for a first pilonidal cyst.. Your doctor makes a cut into the cyst and drains it.. He removes any hair follicles and leaves the wound open, packing the space with gauze.. Advantage -- It's a simple procedure done under local anesthesia, meaning just the area around the cyst is numbed.. Disadvantage -- You have to change the gauze often until the cyst heals, which sometimes takes up to 3 weeks.. Marsupialization: In this procedure, your doctor makes a cut and drains the cyst, removing pus and any hair that are inside.. He'll sew the edges of the cut to the wound edges to make a pouch.. Advantages -- This is outpatient surgery under local anesthesia.. It also lets the doctor make a smaller, shallower cut so that you don't need to take out and repack gauze daily.. Disadvantages -- It takes about 6 weeks to heal, and you need a doctor specially trained in the technique.. Incision, drainage, closing of wound: In this technique, the cyst is drained, but it's not left open.. Advantage -- You don't need to pack gauze because your doctor fully closes the wound right after surgery.. Disadvantages -- You're more likely to have more problems with the cyst down the road.. It's harder to remove the entire cyst with this method.. It's usually done in an operating room with a specially trained surgeon.'. Other surgical procedures include complete cyst and cyst wall excision along with the pilonidal sinus tracts, the use of fibrin glue, and taking (core out) only diseased tissue and the cyst out with punch biopsies.. Follow all of your doctor's instructions about at-home care, especially if you need to remove and pack gauze.. Other tips: Try to keep the area clean.. Check for any signs of a new infection, such as redness, pus, or pain.. Keep your follow-up appointments with your doctor so he can see how your cyst is healing.. A complete cure is possible, but remember that a pilonidal cyst may recur even if you had one surgically removed.","[['Pilonidal cyst', 'history', ""called 'Jeep disease' during World War II""], ['Pilonidal cyst', 'risk factors', 'small dimple in the skin between buttocks'], ['Ingrown hairs', 'found in', 'pilonidal cysts'], ['Pilonidal cyst', 'diagnosis', 'physical exam, questioning about symptoms'], ['Pilonidal cyst', 'treatment', 'antibiotics, hot compresses, depilatory creams, incision and drainage, marsupialization, cyst excision'], ['Incision and drainage', 'procedure for', 'pilonidal cyst'], ['Marsupialization', 'procedure for', 'pilonidal cyst'], ['Cyst excision', 'procedure for', 'pilonidal cyst'], ['Antibiotics', 'do not heal', 'pilonidal cyst'], ['Complete cure', 'possible for', 'pilonidal cyst']]"

For chronic pancreatitis, doctors may test your blood and poop, as well as perform a glucose tolerance test to assess insulin production. Treatment for acute pancreatitis typically involves hospitalization, with care including antibiotics, intravenous fluids, a low-fat diet, and pain medication. For chronic pancreatitis, treatment may include insulin, pain medication, and pancreatic enzymes.

The pancreas is a large gland behind your stomach and next to your small intestine.. Your pancreas does two main things: It releases powerful digestive enzymes into your small intestine to help you digest food.. It releases insulin and glucagon into your bloodstream.. These hormones help your body control how it uses food for energy.. Your pancreas can be damaged when digestive enzymes begin working before your pancreas releases them.. The two forms of pancreatitis are acute and chronic.. Acute pancreatitis is sudden inflammation that lasts a short time.. It can range from mild discomfort to a severe, life-threatening illness.. Most people with acute pancreatitis recover completely after getting the right treatment.. In severe cases, acute pancreatitis can cause bleeding, serious tissue damage, infection, and cysts.. Severe pancreatitis can also harm other vital organs such as the heart, lungs, and kidneys.. Chronic pancreatitis is long-lasting inflammation.. It most often happens after an episode of acute pancreatitis.. Another top cause is drinking lots of alcohol for a long period of time.. Damage to your pancreas from heavy alcohol use may not cause symptoms for many years, but then you may suddenly have severe pancreatitis symptoms.. Symptoms of acute pancreatitis Fever Higher heart rate Nausea and vomiting Swollen and tender belly Pain in the upper part of your belly that goes into your back.. Eating may make it worse, especially foods high in fat.. Symptoms of chronic pancreatitis The symptoms of chronic pancreatitis are similar to those of acute pancreatitis.. But you may also have: Constant pain in your upper belly that radiates to your back.. This pain may be disabling.. Diarrhea and weight loss because your pancreas isn't releasing enough enzymes to break down food Upset stomach and vomiting Acute pancreatitis causes include: Autoimmune diseases Drinking lots of alcohol Infections Gallstones Medications Metabolic disorders Surgery Trauma In up to 15% of people with acute pancreatitis, the cause is unknown.. Chronic pancreatitis causes include: Cystic fibrosis Family history of pancreas disorders Gallstones High triglycerides Longtime alcohol use Medications In about 20% to 30% of cases, the cause of chronic pancreatitis is unknown.. People with chronic pancreatitis are usually men between ages 30 and 40.. Pancreatitis can have severe complications, including: Diabetes if there's damage to the cells that produce insulin Infection of your pancreas Kidney failure Malnutrition if your body can't get enough nutrients from the food you eat because of a lack of digestive enzymes Pancreatic cancer Pancreatic necrosis, when tissues die because your pancreas isn't getting enough blood Problems with your breathing when chemical changes in your body affect your lungs Pseudocysts, when fluid collects in pockets on your pancreas.. They can burst and become infected.. To diagnose acute pancreatitis, your doctor tests your blood to measure two digestive enzymes: amylase and lipase.. High levels of these two enzymes mean you probably have acute pancreatitis.. Other tests can include: Pancreatic function test to find out whether your pancreas is making the right amounts of digestive enzymes Ultrasound, CT scan, and MRI, which make images of your pancreas ERCP, in which your doctor uses a long tube with a camera on the end to look at your pancreatic and bile ducts Biopsy, in which your doctor uses a needle to remove a small piece of tissue from your pancreas to be studied In some cases, your doctor may test your blood and poop to confirm the diagnosis.. They may also do a glucose tolerance test to measure damage to the cells in your pancreas that make insulin.. Treatment for acute pancreatitis You'll probably need to stay in the hospital, where your treatment may include: Antibiotics if your pancreas is infected Intravenous ( IV) fluids, given through a needle Low-fat diet or fasting.. You might need to stop eating so your pancreas can recover.. In this case, you'll get nutrition through a feeding tube.. Pain medicine If your case is more severe, your treatment might include: ERCP to take out gallstones if they're blocking your bile or pancreatic ducts Gallbladder surgery if gallstones caused your pancreatitis Pancreas surgery to clean out fluid or dead or diseased tissue Treatment for chronic pancreatitis If you have chronic pancreatitis, you might need more treatments, including: Insulin to treat diabetes Pain medicine Pancreatic enzymes to help your body get enough nutrients from your food Surgery or procedures to relieve pain, help with drainage, or treat blockages Because many cases of pancreatitis are caused by alcohol abuse, prevention often focuses on limiting how much you drink or not drinking at all.. If your drinking is a concern, talk to your doctor or health care professional about an alcohol treatment center.. A support group such as Alcoholics Anonymous could also help.. Stop smoking, follow your doctor's and dietitian's advice about your diet, and take your medications so you'll have fewer and milder attacks of pancreatitis.","[['pancreatitis', 'affects', 'pancreas'], ['pancreas', 'releases', 'digestive enzymes'], ['pancreas', 'releases', 'insulin and glucagon']]"

It can make you feel nauseous, bloated, or full.. You might have gas or diarrhea, or you might be constipated.. It can bother you for a short while or for hours.. With so many kinds of belly pain, it's no surprise that different things can cause it.. Some are out of your control, like if you have appendicitis.. But you can change a few habits to make other kinds less likely to happen.. If you tend to take big bites and eat without chewing well, you can swallow air, which adds gas to your stomach and can lead to stomach pain.. Take time to chew slowly and swallow without rushing.. This also gives your brain time to realize you're full before you eat too much.. Some people get belly pain between meals, when there's no buffer for the acid in your stomach.. If this happens, eat smaller meals or snacks spaced out throughout the day so your stomach isn't empty for long periods.. The opposite also can cause stomach pain.. If you eat so much that you feel stuffed, your stomach is likely to hurt.. Fatty, fried, or spicy foods could be behind your stomach woes.. They can wreak havoc on your gut as your body digests them.. They also can slow down the process and make you more likely to get constipated.. If you eat more nutritious foods, with a focus on veggies and fiber, you'll digest things at a healthy speed, and your stomach will thank you.. If you notice your stomach always cramps up after you drink a glass of milk or eat a certain thing, see your doctor.. You might have a problem with dairy products (called lactose intolerance) or another kind of food.. If your doctor finds an issue in your diet, she can help you find ways to stay away from it or eat less of it.. It's a good idea to work with your doctor on this instead of trying to figure it out on your own.. You could get on the wrong track and miss out on nutrients from some foods without really needing to.. Water helps keep things moving in your gut so you stay regular.. Pay attention to your body when you're thirsty, and have a glass of water, not soda.. Carbonation can cause stomach pain because the fizz can lead to gas.. Alcoholic and caffeinated beverages can cause trouble for some people, too, so steer clear of them if they bother your stomach.. A common cause of stomach pain is gastroenteritis, sometimes called a stomach bug or a stomach virus.. It can cause diarrhea, nausea, fever, or a headache, too.. The best way to prevent the spread of germs is to wash your hands often, especially before you eat, after you go to the bathroom, and when you've been in public places.. Some people feel their hearts race or their palms sweat when they're stressed or anxious.. And plenty of people have stomach pain.. They may feel their stomachs churn or seem to tie up in knots.. The obvious answer is to stay out of stressful situations when you can.. Since that's not always possible, you can ease stress with things like exercise, meditation, hobbies, or hanging out with friends.. If those don't work, it might help to talk with your doctor or a therapist about ways to manage it.. You can't prevent all types of stomach pain, and in some cases, you may need medicine, surgery, or another kind of treatment.. If you have sharp or severe stomach pain, get medical help right away.. Some things that can cause stomach pain include: Appendicitis Gallstones Kidney stones Stomach ulcers Irritable bowel syndrome Colitis/ Crohn's disease (inflammation of your colon) Celiac disease (a digestive disorder that damages your colon) Ectopic pregnancy (when a fertilized egg is attached outside the uterus) Side effects of medication","[['Stomach pain', 'can be caused by', 'swallowing air'], ['swallowing air', 'can cause', 'stomach pain'], ['Stomach pain', 'can be caused by', 'empty stomach'], ['empty stomach', 'can cause', 'stomach pain'], ['Stomach pain', 'can be caused by', 'eating large meals'], ['eating large meals', 'can cause', 'stomach pain'], ['Stomach pain', 'can be caused by', 'fatty, fried, or spicy foods'], ['fatty, fried, or spicy foods', 'can cause', 'stomach pain'], ['Stomach pain', 'can be caused by', 'lactose intolerance'], ['lactose intolerance', 'can cause', 'stomach pain'], ['Stomach pain', 'can be caused by', 'gastroenteritis'], ['gastroenteritis', 'can cause', 'stomach pain'], ['Stomach pain', 'can be caused by', 'stress or anxiety'], ['stress or anxiety', 'can cause', 'stomach pain']]"

When you know the basics of meal planning, you can make almost any recipe work.. So don't throw out your cookbooks or toss your favorite recipes.. Instead, take some tips about how to cook wisely.. Solid fats often include saturated fats, which you should limit, or trans fats, which you should avoid totally.. If a recipe calls for solid fat like butter, lard, or hydrogenated shortening, try trans-fat free margarine, spreads, or shortening instead.. Check the label to see whether the product will work for cooking or baking.. Many liquid fats -- oils such as canola, corn, olive, and grape seed -- can be healthy when used in moderate amounts.. Some oils have stronger flavors that may affect the taste.. So experiment to find which oils work best with which recipes.. Many dairy products used in cooking and baking are high in fat.. You can lower the fat content without compromising taste.. Instead of whole milk or half-and-half, pour 1% or skim milk, condensed skim milk, or nonfat half-and-half.. Instead of sour cream, try low-fat or nonfat plain yogurt, buttermilk, or even low-fat cottage cheese (you may need to blend it first to make it smooth.). To make a sauce that calls for cream or whole milk, use cornstarch and skim milk.. For many dishes, you can use 25% to 33% less fat than what the recipe says.. Another tip: Substitute applesauce or mashed bananas for some or all of the fat in baked goods.. Or, if you're whipping up a treat that calls for chocolate or chocolate chips, try cocoa powder, or use mini-chocolate chips and use fewer of them.. When cooking up a soup or stew, skim off the fat that floats to the surface while it's on the stove.. Or, place the pot in the refrigerator.. When the fat has hardened at the top, it's easy to skim off.. Choose those that give you energy that lasts and fiber.. When a recipe calls for ""white"" flour, ""white"" rice, or other refined grains, try substituting whole wheat flour, brown rice, or other whole-grain flours or grain products.. You can also use ground nuts such as almond or hazelnut (filbert) meal.. Or you can mix several of these whole-grain ingredients together in the same recipe.. Sugar can quickly raise your blood sugar, unlike the carbs from vegetables or starches, which are absorbed more slowly.. Many times you can cut the amount of sugar without seriously affecting taste or texture, though you may need to add more flour.. An exception: You can't cut corners if something you're baking needs yeast, because the yeast needs the sugar in order to do its job.. If you're using a sugar substitute, check the product label to be sure it's designed for baking.. Reach for ingredients other than sugar, salt, and fat to satisfy your taste buds.. Try out different herbs, spices (cinnamon, cardamom, nutmeg), mustards, and vinegars (balsamic, sherry).. Some spices may even have health benefits of their own.. Cinnamon, for example, may help lower blood sugar levels.. You can also cut the amount of salt in a recipe, unless the recipe includes yeast, which needs the salt for rising.. Or skip the salt entirely when you're cooking, and then sprinkle a little on at the table when it's time to eat.. Another way to reduce how much sodium you get is to choose fresh over canned and frozen foods, which tend to be higher in salt.. If you're cooking with nuts, check that they aren't salted.. If you have favorite recipes that you'd like to make diabetes-friendly, ask your doctor for a referral to a dietitian.. They're experts at helping plan meals that are appropriate for people with diabetes or other health issues.",[]

The ones connected to your bladder are no different.. Trouble with bladder control is common for people with MS.. But it doesn't have to take over your life..

The small ""tickle"" and feeling of pressure that help us know it's time to head to the restroom are intense.. Incontinence is the loss of bladder control.. Sometimes MS will disrupt the nerve signals that direct the movement of urine in your body so that it comes out when you're not ready.. Nocturia means you have to get up a lot during the night to go to the bathroom.. Urinary hesitancy is when you have trouble starting to pee.. A bladder problem is more than an inconvenience.. If you don't get treatment, it can turn into other health issues, including bladder infections, kidney damage, and hygiene problems..

She might recommend that you see a doctor who specializes in bladder problems, called a urologist.. She might also talk to you about some things you can do on your own: Diet changes.. One way to start is to change the liquid you put in your body every day.. Your doctor may recommend that you: Drink no more than 2 quarts of liquids a day Steer clear of drinks with caffeine, such as coffee, tea, and sodas Have no more than one alcoholic drink per day Change your behavior.. Some things you can try: Bladder training aims to let you go longer between your trips to the bathroom.. You start by setting a schedule for when you'll pee.. Then you train yourself to resist the first urge to go and refrain from going until your scheduled time.. Eventually, the time between restroom visits lasts for several hours.. Timed voiding helps people who have a condition that makes it hard for them to get to a bathroom in time, such as a physical disability.. The person follows a schedule with set times to visit the restroom.. This method doesn't try to teach the person to resist the urge to go.. Prompted voiding trains a caregiver to remind someone to go to the bathroom.. The goal is to have fewer accidents by making the person aware that they need to pee every so often.. People often use timed voiding at the same time.. Kegel exercises strengthen the pelvic floor muscles, which help with bladder control.. Your doctor can tell you how to do them.. Absorbent products such as mini-shields that attach to underwear or plastic-backed diapers.. These items help you guard against accidents.. Most of them are disposable, but you can also buy absorbent cloths that you can wash and reuse.. Medications.. If behavior changes don't work, your doctor may prescribe medicines to help with bladder control.. You might also take them while you keep up your behavior training.. These drugs help control muscle movements that force urine out of the bladder: Darifenacin ( Enablex) Fesoterodine ( Toviaz) Imipramine ( Tofranil) Oxybutynin ( Ditropan, Gelnique gel, Oxytrol transdermal patch) Solifenacin ( Vesicare) Tolterodine ( Detrol) Trospium ( Sanctura) Mechanical aids such as: Catheters: Your doctor can put this thin, flexible, hollow tube through your urethra, the tube through which pee leaves your body, and into your bladder to drain urine.. Urethral insert: A thin, flexible solid tube in the urethra that blocks the flow of leaking urine.. External urethral barrier: A self-adhesive patch you can put over the opening where urine comes out.. Surgery.. Doctors usually recommend an operation only as a last resort when other treatments haven't worked.","[['Multiple Sclerosis', 'affects', 'nerves'], ['nerves', 'control', 'muscles'], ['muscles', 'connected to', 'bladder'], ['bladder problems', 'can be treated with', 'behavior changes'], ['behavior changes', 'include', 'diet modifications'], ['behavior changes', 'include', 'bladder training'], ['behavior changes', 'include', 'timed voiding'], ['behavior changes', 'include', 'prompted voiding'], ['bladder training', 'goal', 'increase time between bathroom visits'], ['urethral infections', 'risk', 'lack of treatment for bladder problems'], ['kidney damage', 'risk', 'lack of treatment for bladder problems'], ['hygiene problems', 'risk', 'lack of treatment for bladder problems'], ['doctor', 'recommended for', 'bladder problem treatment'], ['doctor', 'may recommend', 'urologist'], ['doctor', 'may recommend', 'diet changes'], ['diet changes', 'include', 'reducing liquid intake'], ['diet changes', 'include', 'avoiding caffeine'], ['diet changes', 'include', 'limiting alcohol intake'], ['behavior changes', 'include', 'bladder training'], ['behavior changes', 'include', 'timed voiding'], ['behavior changes', 'include', 'prompted voiding'], ['pelvic floor muscles', 'strengthened by', 'Kegel exercises'], ['absorbent products', 'help with', 'guarding against accidents'], ['absorbent products', 'include', 'mini-shields'], ['absorbent products', 'include', 'plastic-backed diapers'], ['absorbent products', 'include', 'washable cloths'], ['medications', 'prescribed for', 'bladder control'], ['medications', 'include', 'darifenacin'], ['medications', 'include', 'fesoterodine'], ['medications', 'include', 'imipramine'], ['medications', 'include', 'oxytbutynin'], ['medications', 'include', 'solifenacin'], ['medications', 'include', 'tolterodine'], ['medications', 'include', 'trospium']]"
99,What dental care supplies should I keep if I have diabetes?,"Toenail scissors and an emery board or nail file, a mirror, seamless, padded socks, a toothbrush with soft, rounded bristles, fluoride toothpaste, dental floss, and antiseptic mouthwash are all dental care supplies that people with diabetes should keep on hand.","[['people with diabetes', 'should keep on hand', 'toenail scissors'], ['toenail scissors', 'used for', 'nail care'], ['toenail scissors', 'used for', 'cutting toenails'], ['people with diabetes', 'should keep on hand', 'emery board'], ['emery board', 'used for', 'filing nails'], ['people with diabetes', 'should keep on hand', 'mirror'], ['mirror', 'used for', 'inspecting feet'], ['people with diabetes', 'should keep on hand', 'seamless socks'], ['seamless socks', 'used for', 'protecting feet'], ['people with diabetes', 'should keep on hand', 'toothbrush'], ['toothbrush', 'has', 'soft rounded bristles'], ['toothbrush', 'used for', 'brushing teeth'], ['people with diabetes', 'should keep on hand', 'fluoride toothpaste'], ['fluoride toothpaste', 'used for', 'brushing teeth'], ['people with diabetes', 'should keep on hand', 'dental floss'], ['dental floss', 'used for', 'cleaning between teeth'], ['people with diabetes', 'should keep on hand', 'antiseptic mouthwash'], ['antiseptic mouthwash', 'used for', 'rinsing mouth']]","If you have diabetes, it's important to maintain good oral health to prevent gum disease and other dental problems.

You'll also know you're prepared in case of diabetes emergencies.. Use this guide to diabetes-care supplies to help make sure you're always well-stocked.. If you're a young adult just starting to live on your own or are new to caring for an older person with diabetes, this guide can help you start off on the right foot.. A glucose monitoring kit helps you track the sugar levels in your blood.. It lets you know when they are getting high or low.. Many kits include: Glucose testing strips A monitor, which usually gives readouts within 5 seconds A carrying case for the meter and, if you take insulin, your insulin, pens, needles, and alcohol swabs Lancets and lancing devices Liquid kits, to make sure your meter readings are correct Some kits include other items, like a clear cap for testing on different parts of your body.. All monitors have a memory feature that keeps track of your past glucose readings.. Some will compute your daily average blood sugar.. If you have problems with your eyesight, some monitors have a voice function that tells you how to check your sugar and gives you your test result.. Some monitors also have a larger font size.. Contact the National Federation for the Blind for a list of products that can help.. If your kit doesn't include one, it's useful to also have: A record book for tracking your blood glucose levels If you inject insulin for your diabetes, you'll want to have these supplies on hand: Insulin Syringes, or disposable or reusable insulin pens Needles A sharps container for safely disposing of needles Glucose tablets or gels 2 glucagon shot kits Depending on where you live, you may be able to buy needles and syringes in bulk without a prescription.. If you buy extra supplies of insulin to cut costs, store bottles that aren't open in the refrigerator until they expire.. You may need to store pens or cartridges another way -- ask your pharmacist.. You can bring cold insulin to room temperature just before using it so you have less pain and irritation.. Or you can keep a bottle you're using at room temperature for up to a month.. But after a month, throw out any opened insulin that isn't used.. Some syringes come with a magnifying lens.. You can put it on the syringe to read the dosage easier.. You can also get safety guards for shots and aids to help steady the needle when you are putting it in the insulin bottle or under your skin.. If you don't have a sharps container, you can re-cap used needles and put them in a heavy-duty opaque (not clear) plastic bottle.. Sharps containers are not costly, though.. Ask your local garbage removal service how to get rid of syringes and needles safely.. Glucose tablets and gels can help you avoid low blood sugar.. If your blood sugar is low (below 70 mg/d L) and you have symptoms of low blood sugar, you can take 3-4 glucose tablets or one serving of glucose gel.. Wait about 15 minutes and then check your blood sugar levels again.. If they are still low, take another 3-4 glucose tablets or a serving of glucose gel.. Continue testing and treating in the same way until your blood sugar levels are normal.. ( If your meter reading is low but you have no symptoms, you should probably retest first to confirm your blood sugar is low, then proceed as above.). You need to keep glucagon with you at all times.. But why two kits?. If you use one, you'll have another on hand in case an emergency happens before you can get to a drugstore.. Glucagon expires in about a year.. Keep track of the date so you can ask your doctor for a new prescription before it expires.. Make sure that the people you're around the most know where you keep your glucagon and how to use it in case you pass out.. If you use an insulin pump, keep these supplies handy: Rapid or fast-acting insulin Infusion sets Reservoirs to hold the insulin Extra batteries An emergency supply of syringes or insulin pens in the unlikely, but possible, event that the pump stops working If you use an insulin pump, it's always good to have extra infusion sets on hand, because you need a new one every few days.. And they do get yanked out sometimes.. Some diabetes educators advise keeping an emergency syringe or pen and insulin in your purse or wallet if you pump.. Another important item to stock if you have type 1 diabetes is: A home ketone test, to test for ketones in your urine or blood This can help you know how well insulin is working to fuel cells.. You can get home ketone test strips for urine at your local drugstore.. Some of the newer home blood-sugar meters can also measure ketone levels in the blood.. But the ketone test strip for meters is different than the one used for checking your blood sugar.. To keep your blood glucose at good levels, it's a good idea to have: Glucose tablets or other emergency sugar sources Healthy snacks for between meals Low-sugar drinks (including water) to stay hydrated Keep a good supply of fast-acting sugars in several places -- such as a backpack, purse, gym locker, and car -- in case of sugar lows.. Glucose tablets are easy to carry.. Other possible sources include apple or orange juice or regular soda.. Chocolate is not good because it takes longer to digest.. If you live with other people, let them know these supplies are not for them to eat.. For emergencies, have on hand: Medical alert ID (such as a bracelet, necklace, or card) that says you have diabetes Emergency contact information Emergency preparedness supplies The American Diabetes Association recommends storing 3 days' worth of diabetes supplies in case of emergencies such as hurricanes, earthquakes, tornados, or blizzards.. Depending on how you manage your diabetes, this could include diabetes pills, insulin and insulin supplies, extra batteries, and quick-acting sources of glucose, as well as standard supplies such as food that doesn't spoil, and water.. Store these supplies in a waterproof container in a place where you can get to them easily.. You may want to keep a set of emergency supplies at home, work, and in your car.. Diabetes can affect every part of your body.. Prevent dry skin and tend to cuts or other wounds right away -- it can help prevent infections and skin conditions.. These items can help you care for your skin: Mild or moisturizing soap Skin moisturizer Antibiotic cream or ointment (if your doctor advises using it), sterile gauze, and paper tape or cloth bandages for cuts Mild shampoo Take good care of your feet to help yourself avoid foot problems that people with diabetes tend to have.. These supplies can help: Toenail scissors and an emery board or nail file Mirror, if needed, to help you inspect your feet daily for cuts or blisters Seamless, padded socks if you have nerve damage in your feet Diabetes raises your chances of getting gum disease and other dental problems.. Keep these supplies handy for daily mouth care: A toothbrush with soft, rounded bristles, which are less likely to hurt your gums than the stiffer bristles on a standard brush Fluoride toothpaste Dental floss, to clean away plaque and food from between teeth and below the gum line Antiseptic mouthwash to rinse daily Replace your toothbrush when the bristles are worn, or every 3 to 4 months.","[['people with diabetes', 'can manage diabetes better', 'if well-stocked'], ['well-stocked', 'includes', 'glucose monitoring kit'], ['glucose monitoring kit', 'helps track', 'sugar levels'], ['glucose monitoring kit', 'includes', 'glucose testing strips'], ['glucose monitoring kit', 'includes', 'monitor'], ['monitor', 'gives readouts within', '5 seconds'], ['monitor', 'has', 'memory feature'], ['monitor', 'has', 'carrying case'], ['people with diabetes', 'should have', 'record book'], ['record book', 'used for', 'tracking blood glucose levels'], ['people with diabetes', 'should have', 'insulin syringes'], ['insulin syringes', 'used for', 'injecting insulin'], ['insulin syringes', 'comes with', 'magnifying lens'], ['people with diabetes', 'should have', 'sharps container'], ['sharps container', 'used for', 'safely disposing needles'], ['people with diabetes', 'should have', 'glucose tablets'], ['people with diabetes', 'should have', 'glucagon shot kits'], ['glucagon shot kits', 'contains', 'glucagon'], ['glucagon', 'expires in', 'about a year'], ['people with diabetes', 'should have', 'emergency syringe or pen'], ['emergency syringe or pen', 'used for', 'insulin administration'], ['people with diabetes', 'should have', 'home ketone test'], ['home ketone test', 'tests for', 'ketones in urine or blood'], ['people with diabetes', 'should have', 'emergency preparedness supplies']]"
