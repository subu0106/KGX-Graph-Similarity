1,Can randomised trials rely on existing electronic data?,"Routine data have the potential to support health technology assessment by RCTs. The cost of data collection and analysis is likely to fall, although further work is required to improve the validity of routine data, particularly in central returns. Better knowledge of the capability of local systems and access to the data held on them is also essential. Routinely captured clinical data have real potential to measure patient outcomes, particularly if the detail and precision of the data could be improved.","[['Routine data', 'supports', 'health technology assessment'], ['RCTs', 'use', 'Routine data']]","Generally, two-thirds of the research questions posed by health technology assessment through RCTs could be answered using routinely collected data. Where these questions required analysis of NHS resource use, data could usually be identified. Clinical effectiveness could also be judged, using proxy measures for quality of life, provided clinical symptoms and signs were collected in sufficient detail.",[],"To estimate the feasibility, utility and resource implications of electronically captured routine data for health technology assessment by randomised controlled trials (RCTs), and to recommend how routinely collected data could be made more effective for this purpose. Four health technology assessments that involved patients under care at five district general hospitals in the UK using four conditions from distinct classical specialties: inflammatory bowel disease, obstructive sleep apnoea, female urinary incontinence, and total knee replacement. Patient-identifiable, electronically stored routine data were sought from the administration and clinical database to provide the routine data. Four RCTs were replicated using routine data in place of the data already collected for the specific purpose of the assessments. This was done by modelling the research process from conception to final writing up and substituting routine for designed data activities at appropriate points. This allowed a direct comparison to be made of the costs and outcomes of the two approaches to health technology assessment. The trial designs were a two-centre randomised trial of outpatient follow-up; a single-centre randomised trial of two investigation techniques; a three-centre randomised trial of two surgical operations; and a single-centre randomised trial of perioperative anaesthetic intervention. Generally two-thirds of the research questions posed by health technology assessment through RCTs could be answered using routinely collected data. Where these questions required analysis of NHS resource use, data could usually be identified. Clinical effectiveness could also be judged, using proxy measures for quality of life, provided clinical symptoms and signs were collected in sufficient detail. Patient and professional preferences could not be identified from routine data but could be collected routinely by adapting existing instruments. Routine data were found potentially to be cheaper to extract and analyse than designed data, and they also facilitate recruitment as well as have the potential to identify patient outcomes captured in remote systems that may be missed in designed data collection. The study confirmed previous evidence that the validity of routinely collected data is suspect, particularly in systems that are not under clinical and professional control. Potential difficulties were also found in identifying, accessing and extracting data, as well as in the lack of uniformity in data structures, coding systems and definitions.",[],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

However, only few in vivo studies have been carried out up until now on the effects of cortisol on human male sexual performance and penile erection. In order to evaluate further the role of cortisol in male sexual activity, the present study was conducted to detect serum levels of cortisol in the systemic and cavernous blood taken during different penile conditions from healthy males. The effects of cortisol derivative prednisolone, catecholamine norepinephrine (NE) and the peptide endothelin-1 (ET-1) on isolated human corpus cavernosum (HCC) were investigated using the organ bath technique. Fifty-four healthy adult male subjects were exposed to erotic stimuli in order to elicit penile tumescence and rigidity. Whole blood was simultaneously aspirated from the corpus cavernosum and the cubital vein during different penile conditions. Serum levels of cortisol (microg/dl) were determined by means of a radioimmunoassay (ELISA). In the healthy volunteers, cortisol serum levels significantly decreased in the systemic circulation and the cavernous blood with increasing sexual arousal, when the flaccid penis became rigid. During detumescence, the mean cortisol level remained unaltered in the systemic circulation, whereas in the cavernous compartment, it was found to decrease further. Under all penile conditions, no significant differences were registered between cortisol levels in the systemic circulation and in the cavernous blood.

The mechanism of reciprocal ST segment depression during acute myocardial infarction is controversial. ""Ischemia at a distance"" or a benign electrical phenomenon has been implicated in numerous reports. Pulsed-wave tissue Doppler (PWTD) echocardiography can be used to examine the regional diastolic motion of the left ventricular myocardial wall and may allow the detection of ischemic segments. We evaluated regional myocardial ischemia using PWTD echocardiography in 48 patients with a first inferior wall myocardial infarction. The left ventricle was divided into 16 segments. PWTD echocardiographic velocities were obtained from each left ventricular segments. Reciprocal ST segment depression was present in 35 patients (Group 1) but not in the remaining 13 patients (Group 2).

The aim of this study is to determine whether there are anatomic differences in the deep cerebral venous drainage in patients with ISAH compared with those with aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage (ASAH) and those without intracranial hemorrhage. We reviewed the venous phase of carotid digital angiograms of 100 consecutive patients who had a final diagnosis of ISAH. We also analyzed the angiograms of a control group of 112 patients with ASAH and the angiograms of a nonhemorrhagic group of 25 patients having incidental aneurysms. The anatomic variants of the basal vein of Rosenthal (BVR) on both sides were classified into the following types: Type A (normal continuous), in which the BVR is continuous with the deep middle cerebral veins and drains mainly into the vein of Galen; Type B (normal discontinuous), in which there is discontinuous venous drainage, anterior to the uncal vein and posterior to the vein of Galen; and Type C (primitive), which drains mainly to veins other than the vein of Galen. We calculated the proportions to analyze the differences in the type of venous drainage between patients with ISAH, patients with ASAH, and patients without hemorrhage. chi2 statistics were used to search for differences.

Our residency program started monthly simulated and critiqued (verbal, written, and video) oral examinations (MSCE) in 2003. The current study explores the outcomes of this intervention. We evaluated ABSCE performance of 48 residents who graduated from a large academic/community program between the years 2001 and 2006 though a prospective study with historical controls. Residents were divided into 2 groups: The intervention group comprised the 2003 to 2006 classes, which underwent MSCE; the historical control group spanned the 2001 and 2002 classes, which did not undergo MSCE. Results in the ABSCE were compared between groups using the Fisher exact test. In addition, the intervention group was queried in relation to the most important aspects of the MSCE as a learning experience through a structured questionnaire. A statistically significant improvement (p = 0.038) in ABSCE first-time pass rates was noted in the intervention group. Examinees unanimously asserted they had been helped by the MSCE. Improvements in clinical reasoning and promotion of self-study were the most often cited benefits of the MSCE.","[['Monthly simulated and critiqued oral examinations (MSCE)', 'started in', '2003'], ['Intervention group', 'comprised of residents from classes', '2003 to 2006'], ['Historical control group', 'comprised of residents from classes', '2001 and 2002'], ['MSCE', 'benefits', ""['improvements in clinical reasoning', 'promotion of self-study']""]]",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
97,Does antioxidant system adaptive response alleviate related oxidative damage with long term bed rest?,Exercise alleviates hypokinesia outcomes by preserving glutathione reductase activity with minor effect on hypokinesia-induced antioxidant response and oxidative stress which both exhibit a high magnitude inter-individual variability.

98,Are encapsulated anterior glass-ionomer restoratives better than their hand-mixed equivalents?,Encapsulated anterior GI restoratives outperform their hand-mixed equivalents for the range of powder to liquid mixing ratios routinely encountered clinically such that they are advocated for use in clinical practice. Anhydrous GI restorative formulations are more susceptible to clinically induced variability on mixing compared with conventional GI restorative formulations that contained a polyalkenoic acidic liquid.,"[['Encapsulated anterior GI restoratives', 'outperform', 'hand-mixed equivalents']]","Yes, the encapsulated anterior glass-ionomer restoratives are better than their hand-mixed equivalents. They exhibited significantly increased compressive fracture strength, elastic modulus and wear resistance compared to their hand-mixed equivalents prepared with powder contents below that recommended by the manufacturers.","[['Encapsulated anterior GI restoratives', 'exhibit', 'increased compressive fracture strength'], ['Encapsulated anterior GI restoratives', 'exhibit', 'increased elastic modulus'], ['Encapsulated anterior GI restoratives', 'exhibit', 'increased wear resistance']]","The performance of encapsulated anterior GI restoratives were compared with their hand-mixed equivalents for the range of powder to liquid mixing ratios routinely encountered clinically. The clinically induced variability of powder to liquid mixing variations of an anhydrous GI restorative formulation was also compared with conventional GI restorative formulations that contained a polyalkenoic acidic liquid. Mean compressive fracture strengths, mean elastic moduli and mean total volumetric wear were determined for the encapsulated anterior GI restoratives mechanically mixed in a Capmix or Rotomix machine and the hand-mixed GI restoratives prepared with powder contents reduced from that recommended by the manufacturer (100%) in 10% increments to 50% for a constant weight of liquid. Multiple comparisons of the group means were made using a one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) and Tukey's multiple range tests employed at P<0.05. For the encapsulated GI restoratives, the mean compressive fracture strength, mean elastic modulus and in-vitro wear resistance were significantly increased compared with their hand-mixed equivalents prepared with powder contents below that recommended by the manufacturers. The conventional GI restoratives resulted in a linear deterioration (R2>0.95) of the mean compressive fracture strength and mean elastic modulus with powder content compared with the bi-modal deterioration for the anhydrous GI restorative.","[['Encapsulated anterior GI restoratives', 'measured', 'mean compressive fracture strengths'], ['Encapsulated anterior GI restoratives', 'measured', 'mean elastic moduli'], ['Encapsulated anterior GI restoratives', 'measured', 'mean total volumetric wear'], ['Hand-mixed GI restoratives', 'measured', 'mean compressive fracture strengths'], ['Hand-mixed GI restoratives', 'measured', 'mean elastic moduli'], ['Hand-mixed GI restoratives', 'measured', 'mean total volumetric wear'], ['Capmix or Rotomix machine', 'mixed', 'encapsulated anterior GI restoratives'], ['Powder contents', 'reduced from recommended', 'hand-mixed GI restoratives'], ['One-way analysis of variance (ANOVA)', 'used for', 'multiple comparisons of group means'], [""Tukey's multiple range tests"", 'employed at', 'P<0.05']]",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

At least 24 cores were excised in all cases (mean 74, range 24-96 cores) and a preoperative diagnosis was established. Subsequently, open surgery using hook-wire localization followed. A second, postoperative diagnosis was independently and blindly made. The association between the pathological types and Breast Imaging Report and Data System (BI-RADS) classification, as well as the discrepancy between preoperative and postoperative diagnoses, was evaluated. The underestimation rate of papillary lesions was 3.6%. When the papillary lesions did not coexist preoperatively with any other precursor breast lesions, the underestimation rate was 0%.
