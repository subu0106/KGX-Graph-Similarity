1,Can randomised trials rely on existing electronic data?,"Routine data have the potential to support health technology assessment by RCTs. The cost of data collection and analysis is likely to fall, although further work is required to improve the validity of routine data, particularly in central returns. Better knowledge of the capability of local systems and access to the data held on them is also essential. Routinely captured clinical data have real potential to measure patient outcomes, particularly if the detail and precision of the data could be improved.","[['Routine data', 'support', 'health technology assessment'], ['RCTs', 'use', 'routine data'], ['Cost', 'potential to fall', 'data collection and analysis'], ['Further work', 'required', 'improve validity of routine data'], ['Capability', 'essential', 'local systems'], ['Data held on them', 'access to', 'routinely captured clinical data'], ['Patient outcomes', 'measure', 'using routinely captured clinical data'], ['Detail and precision', 'improve', 'data'], ['Pancreatic cancer', 'targeted by', 'novel biomarker']]","Randomised trials can rely on existing electronic data to a significant extent, as two-thirds of the research questions posed by health technology assessment through RCTs can be answered using routinely collected data. Clinical effectiveness can be judged using proxy measures for quality of life, and data on NHS resource use can usually be identified. However, patient and professional preferences cannot be identified from routine data, and potential difficulties include identifying, accessing, and extracting data, as well as the lack of uniformity in data structures, coding systems, and definitions. The validity of routinely collected data is also suspect, particularly in systems that are not under clinical and professional control. Despite these challenges, routine data have the potential to be cheaper to extract and analyze than designed data, and they facilitate recruitment and can identify patient outcomes captured in remote systems that may be missed in designed data collection.","[['Routine data', 'answer', 'two-thirds of research questions'], ['Research questions', 'posed by', 'health technology assessment'], ['Clinical effectiveness', 'judged using', 'proxy measures']]","To estimate the feasibility, utility and resource implications of electronically captured routine data for health technology assessment by randomised controlled trials (RCTs), and to recommend how routinely collected data could be made more effective for this purpose. Four health technology assessments that involved patients under care at five district general hospitals in the UK using four conditions from distinct classical specialties: inflammatory bowel disease, obstructive sleep apnoea, female urinary incontinence, and total knee replacement. Patient-identifiable, electronically stored routine data were sought from the administration and clinical database to provide the routine data. Four RCTs were replicated using routine data in place of the data already collected for the specific purpose of the assessments. This was done by modelling the research process from conception to final writing up and substituting routine for designed data activities at appropriate points. This allowed a direct comparison to be made of the costs and outcomes of the two approaches to health technology assessment. The trial designs were a two-centre randomised trial of outpatient follow-up; a single-centre randomised trial of two investigation techniques; a three-centre randomised trial of two surgical operations; and a single-centre randomised trial of perioperative anaesthetic intervention. Generally two-thirds of the research questions posed by health technology assessment through RCTs could be answered using routinely collected data. Where these questions required analysis of NHS resource use, data could usually be identified. Clinical effectiveness could also be judged, using proxy measures for quality of life, provided clinical symptoms and signs were collected in sufficient detail. Patient and professional preferences could not be identified from routine data but could be collected routinely by adapting existing instruments. Routine data were found potentially to be cheaper to extract and analyse than designed data, and they also facilitate recruitment as well as have the potential to identify patient outcomes captured in remote systems that may be missed in designed data collection. The study confirmed previous evidence that the validity of routinely collected data is suspect, particularly in systems that are not under clinical and professional control. Potential difficulties were also found in identifying, accessing and extracting data, as well as in the lack of uniformity in data structures, coding systems and definitions.",[]

However, only few in vivo studies have been carried out up until now on the effects of cortisol on human male sexual performance and penile erection. In order to evaluate further the role of cortisol in male sexual activity, the present study was conducted to detect serum levels of cortisol in the systemic and cavernous blood taken during different penile conditions from healthy males. The effects of cortisol derivative prednisolone, catecholamine norepinephrine (NE) and the peptide endothelin-1 (ET-1) on isolated human corpus cavernosum (HCC) were investigated using the organ bath technique. Fifty-four healthy adult male subjects were exposed to erotic stimuli in order to elicit penile tumescence and rigidity. Whole blood was simultaneously aspirated from the corpus cavernosum and the cubital vein during different penile conditions. Serum levels of cortisol (microg/dl) were determined by means of a radioimmunoassay (ELISA). In the healthy volunteers, cortisol serum levels significantly decreased in the systemic circulation and the cavernous blood with increasing sexual arousal, when the flaccid penis became rigid. During detumescence, the mean cortisol level remained unaltered in the systemic circulation, whereas in the cavernous compartment, it was found to decrease further. Under all penile conditions, no significant differences were registered between cortisol levels in the systemic circulation and in the cavernous blood. Cumulative addition of NE and ET-1 (0.001-10 microM) induced contraction of isolated HCC strips, whereas the contractile response to prednisolone was negligible.","[['Adrenal_corticosteroids', 'significance_in_male_sexual_function', 'evaluated'], ['Cortisol', 'effects_on_human_male_sexual_performance_and_penile_erection', 'investigated'], ['Healthy_males', 'exposed_to_erotic_stimuli', 'elicit_penile_tumescence_and_rigidity'], ['Whole_blood', 'aspirated_from', 'corpus_cavernosum_and_cubital_vein'], ['No_significant_differences', 'registered', 'between_cortisol_levels_in_systemic_circulation_and_cavernous_blood'], ['NE_and_ET-1', 'cumulative_addition', 'induced_contraction_of_isolated_HCC_strips'], ['Prednisolone', 'negligible_contractile_response', 'isolated_HCC']]"

Although experienced video gamers achieve competency faster than nongamers on LapSim programs, that skill set does not translate into improved clinical performance.","[['PGY1 Surgical Residents', 'doubted_justification_of', 'LapSim training programs'], ['LapSim training programs', 'lack_predictive_validity', 'most_domains_GOALS_program'], ['PGY1 Surgical Residents', 'investigated_approaches', 'more_difficult_training_exercises_LapSim'], ['PGY1 Surgical Residents', 'investigated_approaches', 'haptic_technology_ProMis'], ['experienced_video_gamers', 'achieve_competency_faster', 'LapSim_programs'], ['nongamers', 'do_not_translate_improved_clinical_performance', 'LapSim_programs']]","The study found that training novice PGY1 surgical residents to criteria on LapSim simulators had predictive validity for improvement in the performance of laparoscopic cholecystectomy in pigs, specifically in the domain of depth perception.

In all, 21 PGY1 residents performed laparoscopic cholecystectomies in pigs after minimal training; their performance was evaluated by skilled laparoscopic surgeons using the validated tool GOALS (global operative assessment of laparoscopic operative skills: depth perception, bimanual dexterity, efficiency, tissue handling, and overall competence). From the group, 10 residents trained to competency on the LapSim Basic Skills Programs (camera navigation, instrument navigation, coordination, grasping, lifting and grasping, cutting, and clip applying). All 21 PGY1 residents again performed laparoscopic cholecystectomies on pigs; their performance was again evaluated by skilled laparoscopic surgeons using GOALS. Additionally, we studied the rate of learning to determine whether the slow or fast learners on the LapSim performed equivalently when performing actual cholecystectomies in pigs. Finally, 6 categorical residents were tracked, and their clinical performance on all of the laparoscopic cholecystectomies in which they were ""surgeon, junior"" was prospectively evaluated using the GOALS criteria. We found a statistical improvement of depth perception in the operative performance of cholecystectomies in pigs in the group trained on the LapSim. In the other 4 domains, a trend toward improvement was observed. No correlation between being a fast learner and the ultimate skill was demonstrated in the clinical performance of laparoscopic cholecystectomies.

98,Are encapsulated anterior glass-ionomer restoratives better than their hand-mixed equivalents?,Encapsulated anterior GI restoratives outperform their hand-mixed equivalents for the range of powder to liquid mixing ratios routinely encountered clinically such that they are advocated for use in clinical practice. Anhydrous GI restorative formulations are more susceptible to clinically induced variability on mixing compared with conventional GI restorative formulations that contained a polyalkenoic acidic liquid.,"[['Encapsulated anterior GI restoratives', 'outperform', 'hand-mixed equivalents']]","According to a study comparing the performance of encapsulated anterior glass-ionomer restoratives with their hand-mixed equivalents, the encapsulated restoratives exhibited significantly increased mean compressive fracture strength, mean elastic modulus, and in-vitro wear resistance compared to their hand-mixed counterparts prepared with powder contents below that recommended by the manufacturers. Additionally, the study found that the conventional GI restoratives experienced a linear deterioration of mean compressive fracture strength and mean elastic modulus with decreasing powder content, while the anhydrous GI restoratives showed a bi-modal deterioration. These findings suggest that encapsulated anterior glass-ionomer restoratives may offer superior mechanical properties and wear resistance compared to their hand-mixed equivalents.","[['Encapsulated anterior glass-ionomer restoratives', 'exhibit', 'significantly increased mean compressive fracture strength'], ['Encapsulated anterior glass-ionomer restoratives', 'exhibit', 'significantly increased mean elastic modulus'], ['Encapsulated anterior glass-ionomer restoratives', 'exhibit', 'in-vitro wear resistance'], ['Conventional GI restoratives', 'experience', 'linear deterioration of mean compressive fracture strength'], ['Conventional GI restoratives', 'experience', 'linear deterioration of mean elastic modulus'], ['Anhydrous GI restoratives', 'show', 'bi-modal deterioration']]","The performance of encapsulated anterior GI restoratives were compared with their hand-mixed equivalents for the range of powder to liquid mixing ratios routinely encountered clinically. The clinically induced variability of powder to liquid mixing variations of an anhydrous GI restorative formulation was also compared with conventional GI restorative formulations that contained a polyalkenoic acidic liquid. Mean compressive fracture strengths, mean elastic moduli and mean total volumetric wear were determined for the encapsulated anterior GI restoratives mechanically mixed in a Capmix or Rotomix machine and the hand-mixed GI restoratives prepared with powder contents reduced from that recommended by the manufacturer (100%) in 10% increments to 50% for a constant weight of liquid. Multiple comparisons of the group means were made using a one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) and Tukey's multiple range tests employed at P<0.05. For the encapsulated GI restoratives, the mean compressive fracture strength, mean elastic modulus and in-vitro wear resistance were significantly increased compared with their hand-mixed equivalents prepared with powder contents below that recommended by the manufacturers. The conventional GI restoratives resulted in a linear deterioration (R2>0.95) of the mean compressive fracture strength and mean elastic modulus with powder content compared with the bi-modal deterioration for the anhydrous GI restorative.",[]
