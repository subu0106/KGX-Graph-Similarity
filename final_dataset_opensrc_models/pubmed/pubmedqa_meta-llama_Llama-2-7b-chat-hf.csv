1,Can randomised trials rely on existing electronic data?,"Routine data have the potential to support health technology assessment by RCTs. The cost of data collection and analysis is likely to fall, although further work is required to improve the validity of routine data, particularly in central returns. Better knowledge of the capability of local systems and access to the data held on them is also essential. Routinely captured clinical data have real potential to measure patient outcomes, particularly if the detail and precision of the data could be improved.","[['Routine data', 'supports', 'health technology assessment'], ['RCTs', 'use', 'Routine data'], ['Cost', 'of', 'data collection and analysis'], ['Further work', 'required', 'to improve validity of routine data'], ['Capability', 'of local systems', 'essential'], ['Routinely captured clinical data', 'measures', 'patient outcomes'], ['Patient outcomes', 'can be measured', 'if detail and precision improved']]","The study found that generally two-thirds of the research questions posed by health technology assessment through RCTs could be answered using routinely collected data. However, patient and professional preferences could not be identified from routine data and required additional collection. The study also highlighted potential difficulties in identifying, accessing, and extracting data, as well as the lack of uniformity in data structures, coding systems, and definitions.","[['Study', 'found', 'two-thirds of research questions']]","To estimate the feasibility, utility and resource implications of electronically captured routine data for health technology assessment by randomised controlled trials (RCTs), and to recommend how routinely collected data could be made more effective for this purpose. Four health technology assessments that involved patients under care at five district general hospitals in the UK using four conditions from distinct classical specialties: inflammatory bowel disease, obstructive sleep apnoea, female urinary incontinence, and total knee replacement. Patient-identifiable, electronically stored routine data were sought from the administration and clinical database to provide the routine data. Four RCTs were replicated using routine data in place of the data already collected for the specific purpose of the assessments. This was done by modelling the research process from conception to final writing up and substituting routine for designed data activities at appropriate points. This allowed a direct comparison to be made of the costs and outcomes of the two approaches to health technology assessment. The trial designs were a two-centre randomised trial of outpatient follow-up; a single-centre randomised trial of two investigation techniques; a three-centre randomised trial of two surgical operations; and a single-centre randomised trial of perioperative anaesthetic intervention. Generally two-thirds of the research questions posed by health technology assessment through RCTs could be answered using routinely collected data. Where these questions required analysis of NHS resource use, data could usually be identified. Clinical effectiveness could also be judged, using proxy measures for quality of life, provided clinical symptoms and signs were collected in sufficient detail. Patient and professional preferences could not be identified from routine data but could be collected routinely by adapting existing instruments. Routine data were found potentially to be cheaper to extract and analyse than designed data, and they also facilitate recruitment as well as have the potential to identify patient outcomes captured in remote systems that may be missed in designed data collection. The study confirmed previous evidence that the validity of routinely collected data is suspect, particularly in systems that are not under clinical and professional control. Potential difficulties were also found in identifying, accessing and extracting data, as well as in the lack of uniformity in data structures, coding systems and definitions.",[]

With respect to the important immunoregulatory role of the HPA axis, especially under stress, this observation could be of clinical relevance and may at least partly explain stress-induced exacerbation of AD. The present study was designed to investigate whether attenuated responsiveness of the HPA axis to stress represents a characteristic feature of AD or whether it can also be found in other chronic manifestations of atopy. Children (aged 7-12) with allergic asthma (AA; N = 17) and age- and sex-matched healthy controls (N = 18) were exposed to the ""Trier Social Stress Test for Children""(TSST-C), which mainly consists of a free speech and mental arithmetic tasks in front of an audience. Salivary cortisol was measured in ten-minute intervals before and after the TSST-C, while heart rate was monitored continuously. In addition, early morning cortisol levels (after awakening, +10, +20, +30 minutes) were assessed on three consecutive days.

However, only few in vivo studies have been carried out up until now on the effects of cortisol on human male sexual performance and penile erection. In order to evaluate further the role of cortisol in male sexual activity, the present study was conducted to detect serum levels of cortisol in the systemic and cavernous blood taken during different penile conditions from healthy males. The effects of cortisol derivative prednisolone, catecholamine norepinephrine (NE) and the peptide endothelin-1 (ET-1) on isolated human corpus cavernosum (HCC) were investigated using the organ bath technique. Fifty-four healthy adult male subjects were exposed to erotic stimuli in order to elicit penile tumescence and rigidity. Whole blood was simultaneously aspirated from the corpus cavernosum and the cubital vein during different penile conditions. Serum levels of cortisol (microg/dl) were determined by means of a radioimmunoassay (ELISA). In the healthy volunteers, cortisol serum levels significantly decreased in the systemic circulation and the cavernous blood with increasing sexual arousal, when the flaccid penis became rigid. During detumescence, the mean cortisol level remained unaltered in the systemic circulation, whereas in the cavernous compartment, it was found to decrease further. Under all penile conditions, no significant differences were registered between cortisol levels in the systemic circulation and in the cavernous blood. Cumulative addition of NE and ET-1 (0.001-10 microM) induced contraction of isolated HCC strips, whereas the contractile response to prednisolone was negligible.",[]

The results were compared using the chi-square test and the Fisher's test; alpha=5%; the Kaplan-Meier method was used to analyze the duration of breastfeeding and the Wilcoxon test (Breslow) to compare the exclusive, predominant, full and total breastfeeding curves. 94.3% of children of adolescent mothers and 95.9% of children of adult mothers left the maternity hospital being breastfed (p=0.544). The median exclusive breastfeeding duration for both groups was 90 days. After completing one year, 35.3% and 28.5% of children of adolescent and adult mothers, respectively, continued breastfeeding (p=0.254): only breastfeeding 11.5% vs. 8.9% and mixed feeding 23.8% vs. 19.5% (p=0.519). Meat intake by children of adolescent mothers was lower than that of children of adult mothers (13.9% vs. 26.0%; Fisher's test: p=0.031). With regard to egg intake, 11.5% vs. 19.5% of children of adolescent mothers and adult mothers did not eat egg but the results suggested that the egg intake of children of adolescent mothers was higher (p=0.082).","[['Study', 'was_performed_on', 'Children'], ['Children', 'were_selected_from', 'Files_of_CAISM_UNICAMP']]"

Selection criteria were high thyroglobulin (Tg) levels (>10 ng/ml off-levothyroxine treatment) and no detectable radioiodine uptake, on a whole body scan performed with a high dose, in the absence of iodine contamination. Results were interpreted in terms of assumed presence of tumoral tIssue. Sensitivity of nPET-FDG was similar to that of conventional imaging modalities (67%). False negative nPET-FDG (n=16) were observed mostly in cases of micro-lesions (lymph nodes or lung metastases). Conversely, nPET-FDG identified new tumoral sites in 11 cases.

Plasma NT-proBNP was measured in all patients. Overall, 18 patients had manifestations of cardiac involvement, of whom 7 had depressed left ventricular and 8 depressed right ventricular myocardial contractility, and 8 had elevated systolic pulmonary arterial pressure. Patients with reduced contractility had increased mean (SD) NT-proBNP (704 (878) pg/ml versus 118 (112) pg/ml in patients with normal myocardial contractility, p<0.001). Similarly, NT-proBNP was higher in patients with (607 (758) pg/ml) than in patients without (96 (78) pg/ml) manifestations of overall cardiac involvement (p<0.001). Receiver operating characteristic analysis showed NT-proBNP reliably detected depressed myocardial contractility and overall cardiac involvement (area under the curve 0.905 (95% CI 0.814 to 0.996) and 0.935 (95% CI 0.871 to 0.996), respectively). Considering patients with SSc with normal echocardiography and TDE as controls, and using a 125 pg/ml cut-off concentration, sensitivity and specificity were 92% and 71% in the detection of depressed myocardial contractility, and 94% and 78% for overall cardiac involvement.","[['NT-proBNP', 'is_measured_in', 'patients'], ['echocardiography', 'enhanced_by', 'tissue_Doppler_echocardiography'], ['NT-proBNP', 'is_higher_in', 'patients_with_cardiac_involvement'], ['NT-proBNP', 'reliably_detects', 'depressed_myocardial_contractility'], ['NT-proBNP', 'reliably_detects', 'overall_cardiac_involvement'], ['NT-proBNP', 'has_cut_off_concentration', '125_pg/ml'], ['sensitivity', 'of_NT-proBNP', 'is'], ['specificity_of_NT-proBNP', 'is', '71%']]"

The expression of protein associated with synaptic plasticity, including postsynaptic density-95 (PSD-95), synaptophysin, calbindin-28 K, N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor-1 (NMDA-R1), alpha-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methylisoxazole-4-propionic acid receptor (AMPA-R), and glial cell line-derived neurotrophic factor (GDNF), were analyzed by Western blot. (1) Visceral hypersensitivity was noted in the chronic infection group, although the inflammation was nearly eliminated (P<0.05). Severe inflammation and downregulation of visceral sensitivity were observed in the acute infection group (P<0.05). (2) There were many more synaptic vesicles and longer PSD in the chronic infection group than in the control group (P<0.05, respectively). However, in comparison with control rats, disappearance of mitochondria cristae in the synapses, and decrease of synaptic vesicles and length of PSD were observed in the acute infection group. There was no significant difference in width of synaptic cleft among the three groups.
